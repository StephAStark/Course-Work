Suppose that $M$ is a free left $R$-module, over a ring $R$, having a basis with $n$ elements, as well
as a basis with $n+ 1$ elements with $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. Show that $M$ has a basis with $m$ elements,
for each $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ satisfying $m\geq n$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $M, R$, and $n$ be as given above. We will proceed by induction. By supposition, $M$ has a basis
    with $n$ elements. Now, assume that $M$ has a basis with $m\geq n$ elements. So, we need a basis for
    $M$ with $m+1$ elements. By our other supposition, $M$ has a basis with $n+1$ elements. Hence, $M$
    has a basis with $m+1$ elements. Therefore, by mathematical induction, $M$ has a basis with $m$
    elements, for each $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ satisfying $m\geq n$.
