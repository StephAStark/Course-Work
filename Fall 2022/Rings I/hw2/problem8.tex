8. Prove that no finite nonzero $\mathbb{Z}$-module can be injective.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Assume by way of contradiction that there exists a finite nonzero $\mathbb{Z}$-module that is
    injective. Call said $\mathbb{Z}$-module $M$. Since $M$ is finite and nonzero, we have that $|M|=m$
    for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $m\geq2$. Now, let $a\in M$ such that $a\neq0$. Then,
    $|\langle a\rangle|=n$ where $n$ divides $m$ and $n>1$. So, $na=0$ by definition of the order of an
    element. Since we assume that $M$ is injective, we have that every short exact sequence of the form

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
    0 \arrow{r} & M \arrow{r}{\phi_1} & M_2 \arrow{r}{\phi_2} & M_3 \arrow{r} & 0
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}

    is split by Theorem 11. Since the sequence is short exact, we know that $\phi_1$ is $1-1$ by
    observation 8. Therefore, $\ker(\phi_1)=\{0\}$. Now,
    $\phi_1(0)=\phi_1(na)=\phi_1(a+\cdots+a)=\phi_1(a)+\cdots+\phi_1(a)\neq0$ since $a\neq0$ and
    $\phi_1$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-module homomorphism, a contradiction. Thus, there are no finite
    nonzero $\mathbb{Z}$-modules that are injective as desired.
