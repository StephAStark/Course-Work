Show that any prime ideal $p$ in a ring $R$ contains a minimal prime ideal. Using this, show that the
lower nilradical $Nil_* R$ is the intersection of all the minimal prime ideals of $R$.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $R$ be a ring and $p$ a prime ideal in $R$. Note that if $p$ is a minimal ideal itself, we are
    done. Also, note that if $R$ is prime, then we have that $\{0\}\subseteq p$ is a minimal prime ideal
    contained in all prime ideals $p$. So, assume that $p$ is not itself minimal. Let $U$ be an ideal
    such that $U\subset p$.
