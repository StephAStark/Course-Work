Show that in a right artinian ring $R$, every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal.
(Equivalently, $R$ is prime iff it is simple.)\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $R$ be a right artinian ring and let $p$ be a prime ideal in $R$. Assume there exists an ideal
    $I$ of $R$ such that  $p\subseteq I\subset R$.
    %To show the 'equivalently' statement, it is by definition for the <- direction. For the ->
    %direction? Assume not simple. Then there exists at least one I ideal of R with 0not I not R.
    %Consdier it to be the ideal generated by a=Ra. Then, since I not R, there is b in R such that 
    %bRa=0. Since I not 0, we have that a,b not 0, so not prime. QED.
    %Let $R$ be a right artinian ring. We will show the equivalent statement. The argument goes as
    %follows. Assume first that $R$ is simple. We then have that $R$ is prime by definition.
    % Ditch this idea and go directly.
