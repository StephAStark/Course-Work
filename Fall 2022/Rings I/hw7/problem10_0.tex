Show that a nonzero central element of a prime ring $R$ is not a zero-divisor in $R$. In particular,
the center $Z(R)$ is a (commutative) domain, and $char R$ is either $0$ or a prime number.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $R$ be a prime ring and let $a$ be a nonzero central element. Assume by way of contradiction
    that $a$ is a zero divisor. So, there exists $b\in R\setminus\{0\}$ such that $ab=ba=0$. Now,
    cosider the ideal $\langle a\rangle\langle b\rangle=(RaR)(RbR)=RabR=\{0\}$ since $a$ is a central
    element of $R$. This means that either $a=0$ or $b=0$ which contradicts $a,b\neq0$. Therefore, $a$
    is not a zero divisor. Now, since $a\in Z(R)$ was arbitrary, we have that $Z(R)$ is a commutative
    domain since no element of the center is a zero divisor.
