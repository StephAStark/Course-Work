Show that for a semisimple module $M$ over any ring $R$ , the following conditions are equivalet:\\
(1) M is finitely generated\\
(2) M is neotherian\\
(3) M is artinian\\
(4) M is a finite direct sum of simple modules\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $R$ and $M$ be as given above. By a theorem, we have that $1$ is equivalent to $4$. Also, by
    theorem 3 from the noetherian unit, we have that $M$ being noetherian imples that $M$ is finitely
    generated. So, $2$ imples $1$. Now, assume that $M$ is a finite direct sum of simple modules.
