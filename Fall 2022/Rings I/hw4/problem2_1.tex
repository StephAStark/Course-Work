Is any subring of a left semisimple ring left semisimple? Can any ring be embedded as a subring of
a left semisimple ring?\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    No. Consider the ring $\mathbb{R}$. We know that $\mathbb{R}$ is left semisimple since it is a field
    and also since $_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{R}$ is simple. Now consider the subring $\mathbb{Z}$ of
    $\mathbb{R}$. Clearly $\mathbb{Z}$ is not left semisimple even though it is a subring of a left
    semisimple ring since $_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{Z}$ is not simple. However, we can embed any ring as a
    subring of a left semisimple ring.
