What are semisimple $\mathbb{Z}$-modules?\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We know that simple modules of $\mathbb{Z}$ are exactly the ones of the form $\mathbb{Z}_p$ where
    $p$ is prime. Since semisimple modules are the direct sum of simple modules, we have that the
    semisimple modules of $\mathbb{Z}$ are of the form $\bigoplus_p\mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is prime.
    That is, the semisimple $\mathbb{Z}$-modules are the direct sums of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ over the primes.
