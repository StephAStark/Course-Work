Let $R$ be a domain. If $R$ has a minimal left ideal, show that $R$ is a division ring.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $R$ be a domain, and let $I$ be a minimal left ideal of $R$. Let $x\in R\setminus\{0\}$ and let
    $a\in I\setminus\{0\}$. Consider the left ideal $Ra$. We have that $Ra\subseteq I$ and by the
    minimality of $I$, $Ra=I$. Hence, $R(xa)=Ra$. So, there exists $y\in R$ such that $a=yxa$. Whence
    $a-yxa=(1-yx)a=0$. Since $a\neq0$ and $R$ is a domain, $1-yx=0$. That is $yx=1$. Since $x\neq0$ was
    arbitrary, we have that $R$ is a division ring as desired.
