Let $E = End_R(M)$ be the ring of endomorphisms of an $R$-module $M$, and let $nM$ denote the
direct sum of $n$ copies of $M$. Show that $End_R(nM)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{M}_n(E)$.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $E, R, M$, and $nM$ be as given above. Consider $\pi_j:nM\rightarrow M$ and
    $\iota_i:M\rightarrow nM$ the natural projection and inclusion maps respectively with respect to the
    $j^{th}$ component. Now, let $\phi\in End_R(nM)$. Then, we see that $\pi_j(\phi(\iota_i))\in E$.
    Now, define $\psi:End_R(nM)\rightarrow\mathbb{M}_n(E)$ by $\psi(\phi)=[\pi_j(\phi(\iota_i))]$ where
    $\pi_j(\phi(\iota_i))$ is the $ij^{th}$ element of the $n\times n$ matrix. Clearly, we see that
    $\psi(\phi)=(0)_{n\times n}$ if and only if $\phi=0$. So, $\psi$ is $1-1$. We can also see that
    $\psi$ is onto. Now, let $\phi,\tau\in End_R(nM)$. Then,

    $$\psi(\phi+\tau)=[(\pi_j(\phi+\tau(\iota_i)))]$$
    $$=[(\pi_j(\phi(\iota_i)))]+[(\pi_j(\tau(\iota_i)))]=\psi(\phi)+\psi(\tau)$$

    and

    $$\psi(\phi\tau)=[(\pi_j(\phi\tau(\iota_i)))]$$
    $$=[(\pi_j(\phi(\iota_i)))][(\pi_j(\tau(\iota_i)))]=\psi(\phi)\psi(\tau)$$

    since $\iota_i\pi_j=e$ the identity map when $i=j$ but $\iota_i\pi_j=0$ when $i\neq j$. Therefore,
    $\psi$ is a ring isomorphism and thus $End_R(nM)\cong\mathbb{M}_n(E)$ as desired.
