    Let $R$ be a ring.\\
    $(1\Leftrightarrow2)$. Let $a\in R$ and let $u\in U(R)$ such that $a=aua$. Since $u$ is a unit in
    $R$, there exists $v\in R$ such that $uv=vu=1$. Since $a=aua$, $ua=uaua$. Hence, $ua$ is an
    idempotent in $R$. Whence, setting $ua=e$, we have that $vua=a=ve$. Since $v$ is also a unit in $R$,
    $a$ is a unit times an idempotent. Conversely assume that $a\in R$ is a unit $v$ times an idempotent
    $e$. That is $a=ve$. Since $v$ is a unit, there exists $u\in U(R)$ such that $vu=uv=1$. Therefore,
    $uve=e=ua$. That is $ua$ is an idempotent. So, $ua=uaua$. Whence, $ua-uaua=u(a-aua)=0$. Thus,
    $vu(a-aua)=a-aua=0$. Hence, $a=aua$ for some unit $u$ in $R$.\\

    $(1\Leftrightarrow2')$. Let $a\in R$ and let $u\in U(R)$ such that $a=aua$. Since $u$ is a unit in
    $R$, there exists $v\in R$ such that $uv=vu=1$. Since $a=aua$, $au=auau$. Hence, $au$ is an
    idempotent in $R$. Whence, setting $au=e$, we have that $auv=a=ev$. Since $v$ is also a unit in $R$,
    $a$ is an idempotent times a unit. Conversely assume that $a\in R$ is an idempotent $e$ times a unit
    $v$. That is $a=ev$. Since $v$ is a unit, there exists $u\in U(R)$ such that $vu=uv=1$. Therefore,
    $evu=e=au$. That is $au$ is an idempotent. So, $au=auau$. Whence, $au-auau=(a-aua)u=0$. Thus,
    $(a-aua)uv=a-aua=0$. Hence, $a=aua$ for some unit $u$ in $R$.\\

    $(1\Rightarrow3)$. Let $a\in R$ and let $u\in U(R)$ such that $a=aua$. Let $b\in R$ such that
    $ab=1$. We will show that $ba=1$. Since $ab=1$, we have that $aba=a$. By assumption, that means $b$
    is a unit in $R$. Since $b$ is a unit in $R$, we have that $ab=ba=1$ and thus $R$ is Dedekind finite
    as desired.
