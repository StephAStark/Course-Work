Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Show that $I=kG\cdot rad\;kH$ is an ideal of $kG$. If
$rad\;kH$ is nilpotent, show that $I$ is also nilpotent. (In particular, if $H$ is finite, $I$ is always
nilpotent.)\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $H, G$, and $I$ be as stated above. Define $f:kH\rightarrow kH$ by $f(h)=ghg^{-1}$. Then, we see
    that $f$ is onto. Now, let $x,y\in kH$. Then, $f(x+y)=g(x+y)g^{-1}=gxg^{-1}+gyg^{-1}=f(x)+f(y)$ and
    $f(xy)=gxyg^{-1}=gxg^{-1}gyg^{-1}=f(x)f(y)$. So, $f$ is a surjective homomorphism. Now, let
    $x\in\ker(f)$. Then, $f(x)=gxg^-1=0$. Hence, $x=0$. Thus, $f$ is an automorphism. We can extend this
    to be a mapping of $kG$ and $f$ will preserve $kH$ as well as $rad(kH)$. We can conclude that
    $g\cdot rad(kH)=rad(kH)\cdot g$ for all $g\in kG$. So, now let $r\in kG$ and $i\in I$. Then,
    $ri\in I$ due to the closure of $kG$. Also, $ir=ri\in I$ by our conclusion and the closure of $kG$.
    Thus, $I$ is an ideal of $kG$ as desired.
