Let $\mathfrak{A}_i\;(i\in I)$ be ideals in a ring $R$, and let
$\mathfrak{A}=\bigcap_i\mathfrak{A}_i$. True or False: "If each $R/\mathfrak{A}_i$ is $J$-semisimple,
then so is $R/\mathfrak{A}$"?\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $R, \mathfrak{A}_i\;(i\in I)$, and $\mathfrak{A}_i$ be as above. This statement is true. Since
    each $\mathfrak{A}_i$ is an ideal of $R$, we have that each $\mathfrak{A}_i$ is contained in a
    maximal ideal of $R$. Whence, $\mathfrak{A}$ is also contained in a maximal ideal of $R$. So, each
    $\mathfrak{A}_i\subseteq rad R=J$ and $\mathfrak{A}\subseteq J$. Hence,
    $\{0\}=rad(R/\mathfrak{A}_i)=(rad(R))/\mathfrak{A}_i$ since each $R/\mathfrak{A}_i$ is
    $J$-semisimple. So,
    $\{0\}=\bigcap_i\{0\}=\bigcap_i((rad R)/\mathfrak{A}_i)=(rad R)/\mathfrak{A}=rad(R/\mathfrak{A})$.
    Thus, $R/\mathfrak{A}$ is also $J$-semisimple.
