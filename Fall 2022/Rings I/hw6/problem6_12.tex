Assume $char(k)=3$, and let $G=S_3$ (symmetric group on three letters)\\
1. Compute the Jacobson radical $J=rad(kG)$, and the factor ring $kG/J$.\\
2. Determine the index of nilpotency for $J$, and find a $k$-basis for $J^i$ for each $i$.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    1. Consider the augmentation map $\phi:kG\rightarrow k$ as defined in class. Then, we have that the
    kernel $\ker(\phi)=J$ and thus, $kG/J=\{b+\ker(\phi)|b\in kG\}$ is the quotient ring.\\

    2. The index of nilpotency for $J$ is 18 which is the product of the characteristic of $k$ and the
    order of $G$.

\end{solution}
