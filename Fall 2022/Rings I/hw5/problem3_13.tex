Let $R$ be a simple, infinite-dimensional algebra over a field $k$. Show that any nonzero left
$R$-module $V$ is also infinite-dimensional over $k$.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $R$ and $k$ be as given. Let $M\neq\{0\}$ be a left $R$-module over $k$. Assume that $M$ is
    finite dimensional. Then, we have that $M$ is an $R$-vector space since $k$ is field, so $M$ has a
    finite basis. Let $\{m_1,\ldots,m_n\}$ be a basis for $M$ for $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. Now, observe the
    ideal $Rm_1$. Since $R$ is simple and $m_1$ is an element of a basis for $M$, we have that $Rm_1=R$.
    Since $m_1$ is part of a finite set, we have that $R$ must be finite dimensional which is a
    contradiction. Thus, $M$ is infinite dimensional as desired.
