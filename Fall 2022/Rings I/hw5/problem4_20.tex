4.20. For any left artinian ring $R$ with Jacobson radical $J$, show that

$$soc(_RR)=\{r\in R|Jr=0\}\;\;\text{and}\;\;soc(R_R)=\{r\in R|rJ=0\}$$

Using this, construct an artinian ring $R$ in which $soc(_RR)\neq soc(R_R)$.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $R$ and $J$ be as stated above. By the problem above, we have that $soc(_RR)=\{r\in R|Jr=0\}$ if
    $R/J$ is artinian. Since $R$ is left artinian and $J$ is an ideal of $R$, $R/J$ is indeed artinian.
    Hence, we have that $soc(_RR)=\{r\in R|Jr=0\}$. Now, since $R/J$ is artinian and $rad(R/J)=\{0\}$,
    then $R/J$ is $J$-semisimple. This gives us that $R/J$ is semisimple same as above.
