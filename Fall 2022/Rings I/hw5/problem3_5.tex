Let $M$ be a finitely generated left $R$-module and $E=End(_RM)$. Show that if $R$ is semisimple
(resp. simple artinian), then so is $E$.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $R, M$, and $E$ be as given. Suppose that $R$ is semisimple. This means that $M$ is also
    semisimple. Then, we have that $M$ is the finite direct sum of simple $R$-modules. Group together
    the left simple modules that are isomorphic. Then $_RM\cong N^{n_1}_1\times\ldots\times N^{n_m}_m$
    for some simple left $R$-modules $N_i$, $m,n_i\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, $1\leq i\leq m$ with $N_i\ncong N_j$
    for $i\neq j$. We have that $M\cong End(_RM)$. So,
    $M\cong End(N^{n_1}_1\times\ldots\times N^{n_m}_m)$. Since each submodule $N_i$ is simple and
    $N_i\ncong N_j$ for $i\neq j$, there are no nonzero homomorphisms $N^{n_i}_i\rightarrow N^{n_j}_j$
    for $i\neq j$. Therefore, we can write $M\cong End(N^{n_1}_1)\times\ldots\times End(N^{n_m}_m)$.
    Now, $End(N^{n_i}_i)\cong\mathbb{M}_{n_i}(End(N_i))$ for all $1\leq i\leq m$. Whence,
    $\mathbb{M}_{n_i}(End(N_i))$ is a matrix ring over a division ring by Schur's Lemma. Thus, $E$ is a
    finite direct product of simple modules and is therefore semisimple as desired.
