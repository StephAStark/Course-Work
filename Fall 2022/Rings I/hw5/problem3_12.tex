For a subset $S$ in a ring $R$, let $ann_l(S)=\{a\in R|aS=0\}$ and $ann_r(S)=\{a\in R|Sa=0\}$. Let $R$
be a semisimple ring, $I$ be a left ideal and $J$ be a right ideal in $R$. Show that
$ann_l(ann_r(I))=I$ and $ann_r(ann_l(J))=J$.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $R$ be a semisimple ring. Then, every left and right ideal of $R$ is generated by an idempotent.
    Let $e$ be an idempotent of $R$. Then, we have that $e'=1-e$ is also an idempotent of $R$. Now, by
    problem 1.7, we have that $R=Re\oplus e'R$ since clearly $ee'=0=e'e$. So, let $I=Re$ and $J=e'R$.
    Then, $ann_r(I)=\{a\in R|aRe=0\}$. We can see that $e'\in ann_r(I)$ as
    $e'Re=e're=(1-e)re=re-ere=re-re^2=re-re=0$ for all $r\in R$. So, $ann_r(I)=J$ since $e'$ generates
    $J$. Then, $ann_l(J)=\{a\in R|e'Ra=0\}$. Clearly, $e\in ann_l(J)$ since $e'Re=e're=0$ as seen above,
    and since $e$ generates $I$, we have that $ann_l(J)=I$. Therefore, we have that $ann_l(ann_r(I))=I$
    and $ann_r(ann_l(J))=J$ as desired.
