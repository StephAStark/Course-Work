10.9.a. Modify the m-file to create a version advection\_lf\_pbc.m implementing the leapfrog method and
verify that this is second order accurate. Note that you will have to specify two levels of initial
data. For the convergence test set $U^1_j=u(x_j,k)$, the true solution at time $k$.\\
b. Modify advection\_lf\_pbc.m so that the initial data consists of a wave packet
$\eta(x) =exp(-\beta(x-0.5)^2)\sin(\xi x)$. Work out the true solution $u(x, t)$ for this data. Using
$\beta =100$, $\xi=80$ and $U^1_j=u(x_j , k)$, test that your code still exhibits second order accuracy
for $k$ and $h$ sufficiently small.\\
c. Using $\beta= 100$, $\xi =150$ and $U^1_j=u(x_j , k)$, estimate the group velocity of the wave packet
computed with leapfrog using $m = 199$ and $k = 0.4h$. How well does this compare with the value (10.52)
predicted by the modified equation?\\
