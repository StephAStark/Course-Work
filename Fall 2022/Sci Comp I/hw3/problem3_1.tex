a. Test this script by performing a grid refinement study to verify that it is second order accurate.\\
b. Modify the script so that it works on a rectangular domain $[a_x, b_x]\times[a_y, b_y]$, but still
with $\Delta x=\Delta y=h$. Test your modified script on a non-square domain.\\
c. Further modify the code to allow $\Delta x\neq\Delta y$ and test the modified script.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Here, the code was edited to be in a for loop so that the $m$ values would increase in size from 200
    to 2000. We see that the order of accuracy converges to $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$.\\

    The code here was editied to be a rectangular domain of $[0,1]\times[0,2]$. The code was also
    editied such that $h$ was the same with $h=0.2$.\\

    The code here was only slightly edited such that $h_x=0.2$ and $h_y=0.2222$.\\
