Test the finite difference formula to approximate $u''(1)$ for $u(x)=\sin(2x)$ with values of $h$ from
the MATLAB array. Make a table of the error vs. $h$ for several values of $h$ and compare against the
predicted error from the leading term of the printed expression. Also produce a log-log plot of the
absolute error vs. $h$.\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Since we are approximating $u''(1)$, we need $u''(x)=-4\sin(2x)$. We see that the approximation is
    accurate to 6 decimal places. We also have the log-log plot and table of values. See the MATLAB code
    and output below
