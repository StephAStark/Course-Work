Compute the coefficients using MATLAB and check that they satisfy the above system.\\


\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We have that the MATLAB code returns the same coeffiecients found above, baring the $\frac{1}{h^2}$
    factor shared among the coefficients. That is,
    $c_{-2}=-\frac{1}{12h^2}, c_{-1}=\frac{4}{3h^2}, c_0=-\frac{5}{2h^2}, c_1=\frac{4}{3h^2},$ and
    $c_2=-\frac{1}{12h^2}$. See the code and the output below.
