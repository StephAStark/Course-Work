Let $f$ be a continuous function on $\mathbb{R}$ and define $G(x)=\int_0^{\sin x}f(t)dt$ for
$x\in\mathbb{R}$. Show $G$ is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ and compute $G'$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, since $f$ is contionuous, $f$ is integrable. Now, since $f$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ and
    $\sin x$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is continuous at $\sin x$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$. So
    by theorem 34.4, $G$ is differentiable and $G'(x)=f(\sin x)$.
