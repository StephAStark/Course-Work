Give an example of a function $f$ on $[0,1]$ that is not integrable for which $|f|$ is integrable.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Consider the function $f:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ definded by $f(x)=1$ for $x\in\mathbb{Q}$ and
    $f(x)=-1$ for $x\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$. Then by a similar calculation as in example 2 of
    section 32, we see that $U(f,P)=1$ and $L(f,P)=-1$. So, the upper and lower Darboux sums don't agree
    and $f$ is not integrbale. However, $|f(x)|=1$ on $[0,1]$. Thus, $f$ is constant and therefore
    continuous, and hence integrable on $[0,1]$.
