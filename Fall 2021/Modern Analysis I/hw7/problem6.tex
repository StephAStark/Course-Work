Prove $M(|f|,S)-m(|f|,S)\leq M(f,S)-m(f,S)$ for any subset $S$ of $[a,b]$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $S$ be a subset of $[a,b]$, and let $x_0,y_0\in S$. Well, we have that
    
    $$|f(x_0)|-|f(y_0)|\leq|f(x_0)-f(y_0)|\leq M(f,S)-m(f,S)$$
    
    Now, by the reverse triangle inequality, we have that
    
    $$||f(x_0)|-|f(y_0)||\leq M(f,S)-m(f,S)$$
    
    Thus, we have that

    $$M(|f|,S)-m(|f|,S)\leq M(f,S)-m(f,S)$$

\end{solution}
