Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions on $[a,b]$ such that $\int_a^bf=\int_a^bg$. Prove that
there exists $x\in(a,b)$ such that $f(x)=g(x)$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous, $f-g$ is continuous and therefore integrable. So, by the
    Intermediate Value Theorem for Integrals, there exists $x\in(a,b)$ such that
    
    $$(f-g)(x)=f(x)-g(x)=\frac{1}{b-1}\int_a^bf-g=\frac{1}{b-a}(\int_a^bf-\int_a^bg)$$
    
    Since $\int_a^bf=\int_a^bg$, we have that $f(x)-g(x)=0$. Thus, there exists $x\in(a,b)$ such that
    $f(x)=g(x)$.
