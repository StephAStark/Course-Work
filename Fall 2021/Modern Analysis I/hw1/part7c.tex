Show $lim f_n(x)$ does not exist if $x$ is an odd multiple of $\pi$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We are aware that $\cos(x)=-1$ if $x$ is an odd multiple of $\pi$. So, we let $x$ be an odd
    multiple of $\pi$. So, we get $lim f_n(x)=lim (-1)^n$ which does not exist since it alternates
    between $1$ and $-1$.

\end{solution}
