Show $lim f_n(x)=1$ if $x$ is an even multiple of $\pi$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    As we know, $\cos(x)=1$ if $x$ is an even multiple of $\pi$. So, let $x$ be as such. Then we have
    that $f_n(x)=1^n=1$, and thus we have that $lim f_n(x)=1$ if $x$ is an even multiple of $\pi$.

\end{solution}
