Based on the work in part a, does the series converge or diverge? What about the series
$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}(-1)^na_n$?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    The series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ does not converge by both the ratio and the root test as
    calculated above. Also, the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^na_n$ diverges by the alternating
    series test.

\end{solution}
