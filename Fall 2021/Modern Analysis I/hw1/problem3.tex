Find the interval of convergence for the power series as in exmaple 6.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Take the power series from example 6. So, we have $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n}x^{3n}$, and we know
    that the radius of convergence is $2^{\frac13}$. Now, plugging in $x=2^{\frac13}$ into the series we
    get
    
    $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n}2^{n}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{n-n}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 1$$
    
    which diverges to infinity. If we then take $x=-2^{\frac13}$, we clearly get $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}-1$
    which diverges to negative infinity. Thus, the exact interval of convergence is
    $(-2^{\frac13},2^{\frac13})$.
