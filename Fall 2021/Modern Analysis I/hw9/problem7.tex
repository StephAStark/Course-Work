    Let $f$ be as given and $\epsilon>0$. Now, let $K>0$ be such that $|f|\leq K$ since $f$ is
    $F$-integrable. So, $\frac{\epsilon}{2K}>0$. Now, let $x,y\in[a,b]$ and $P$ be a partition of
    $[a,b]$. Well,
    
    $$f(x)^2-f(y)^2=(f(x)+f(y))(f(x)-f(y))$$
    
    So,
    
    $$f(x)^2-f(y)^2\leq|f(x)+f(y)||f(x)-f(y)|\leq|f(x)|+|f(y)|(|f(x)-f(y)|)$$
    $$\leq2K|f(x)-f(y)|\leq2K(M(f,S)-m(f,S))$$
    
    Hence
    
    $$M(f^2,P)-m(f^2,P)\leq 2K(M(f,S)-m(f,S))$$
    
    Therefore
    
    $$(M(f^2,S)-m(f^2,S))(t_k-t_{k-1})\leq2K(M(f,S)-m(f,S))(t_k-t_{k-1})$$
    
    and so
    
    $$U_F(f^2,P)-L_F(f^2,P)=\sum_{k=1}^n(M(f^2,S)-m(f^2,S))(t_k-t_{k-1})$$
    $$\leq2K\sum_{k=1}^n(M(f,S)-m(f,S))(t_k-t_{k-1})=2K[U_F(f,P)-L_F(f,P)]$$
    
    Since $f$ is $F$-integrable, there exists a partition $P'$ of $[a,b]$ such that
    $U_F(f,P')-L_F(f,P')<\frac{\epsilon}{2K}$. So, we have that
    
    $$U_F(f^2,P')-L_F(f^2,P')\leq2K[U_F(f,P')-L-F(f,P')]<2K\frac{\epsilon}{2K}=\epsilon$$
    
    
    Thus, $f^2$ is $F$-integrable on $[a,b]$.\\
    
    Let $f$ and $g$ be as given. Clearly if $f=g$, then $fg$ is $F$-integrable by part a. So, assusme
    that $f\neq g$. Now, $4fg=(f+g)^2-(f-g)^2$. Well, since $f$ and $g$ are $F$-integrable and $(f+g)$
    is $F$-integrable, by part a above, we have that $(f+g)^2$ and $(f-g)^2$ are both $F$-integrable.
    Hence, we have that $(f+g)^2-(f-g)^2$ is also $F$-integrable. Thus, $4fg$ is $F$-integrable and so
    $fg$ is $F$-integrable.\\

    Well, $\max(f,g)=\frac12(f+g)-\frac12|f-g|$. Now, $(f+g)$ and $(f-g)$ are $F$-integrable and so is
    $|f-g|$, so $\frac12(f+g)$ and $-\frac12|f-g|$ are as well. Thus
    $\max(f,g)=\frac12(f+g)-\frac12|f-g|$ is $F$-integrable. Now, since $\min(f,g)=-\max(-f,-g)$, we
    have that $\min=\frac12|g-f|-\frac12(-f-g)$ is also $F$-integrble by the same reasons as above.
