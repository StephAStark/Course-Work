Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.\\

a. Show $\int_a^bfdF=f(x)(F(b)-F(a))$ for some $x\in[a,b]$.\\

b. Show problem 33.14 is a special case of part a.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Since $f$ is continuous, let $m<M$ be such that $m\leq f(x)\leq M$ for all $x\in[a,b]$. Then
    
    $$\int_a^bmdF\leq\int_a^bfdF\leq\int_a^bMdF$$
    
    Hence $m\leq\frac{\int_a^bfdF}{F(b)-F(a)}\leq M$. Now, since $f(x)$ is continuous, we have that
    there exists $x\in[a,b]$ such that $f(x)=\frac{\int_a^bfdF}{F(b)-F(a)}$. That is, there exists
    $x\in[a,b]$ such that $\int_a^bfdF=f(x)(F(b)-F(a))$.\\

    Well, let $F(x)$ be as in problem 8, and $f$ and $g$ be as in problem 33.14. Then by part a, we have
    that there exists $x\in[a,b]$ such that
    
    $$\int_a^bf(x)g(x)dx=\int_a^bfdF=f(x)(F(b)-F(a))=f(x)\int_a^bg(x)dx$$
    
    So, 33.14 is a special case of part a.
