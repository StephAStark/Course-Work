a. Suppose $f$ is twice differentiable on an open interval $I$ and $f''(x)=0$ for all $x\in I$. Show $f$
has the form $f(x)=ax+b$ for suitable constants $a$ and $b$.\\

b.Suppose $f$ is three times differentiable on an open interval $I$ and $f'''(x)=0$ on $I$. What form
does $f$ have? Prove your claim.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $f$ and $I$ be as given. Since $f''(x)=0$ for all $x\in I$, we know that $f'(x)=a$ for all
    $x\in I$ for some constant $a$ by corollary 29.4. Now, let $g(x)=ax$. We then see that $f'(x)=g'(x)$
    for all $x\in I$. So, by corollary 29.5, we have that $f(x)=g(x)+b=ax+b$ for some constant $a$ and a
    suitable constant $b$.\\

    Well, we know that $f'(x)=ax+b$ for suitable constants $a$ and $b$. Now, let
    $h(x)=\frac{a}{2}x^2+bx$. We then see that $h'(x)=ax+b=f'(x)$. So, by corollary 29.5, we see that
    $f(x)=h(x)+c=\frac{a}{2}x^2+bx+c$ for appropriate constants $a ,b$, and $c$.
