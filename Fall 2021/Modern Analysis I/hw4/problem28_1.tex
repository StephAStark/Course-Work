For each of the following functions defined on $\mathbb{R}$, give the set of points at which it is not
differentiable.\\

c. $|\sin x|$.\\

f. $|x^3-8|$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    This function is not differentiable at every point where $\sin x=0$. So, $|\sin x|$ is not
    differentiable at the points$\{x|x=n\pi,n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$.\\

    This function is not differentiable at every point where $x^3-8=0$. So, $|x^3-8|$ is not
    differentiable at the point $x=2$.

\end{solution}
