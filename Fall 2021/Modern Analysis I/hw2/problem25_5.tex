Let $f_n$ be a sequence of bounded functions on a set $S$, and suppose $f_n\rightarrow f$ uniformly on
$S$. Prove $f$ is a bounded function on $S$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $f_n$, $f$, and $S$ be as given above. Since $f_n\rightarrow f$ uniformly on $S$, there exists
    an $\epsilon$ such that $|f_n-f|<\epsilon$. By reverse triangle inequality, we have
    $||f_n|-|f||<\epsilon$. Since $f_n$ is bounded, we have that $|f_n|\leq M$ for some $M\in\mathbb{R}$
    for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. So, $|M-|f||<\epsilon$. Hence, $\epsilon<M-|f|<\epsilon$, thus
    $M-\epsilon<|f|<M+\epsilon$. So, $f$ is a bounded function on $S$.
