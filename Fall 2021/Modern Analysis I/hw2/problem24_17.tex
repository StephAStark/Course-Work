Let $f_n$ be a sequence of continuous functions on $[a,b]$ that converges uniformly to $f$ on $[a,b]$.
Show that if $x_n$ is a sequence in $[a,b]$ and if $x_n\rightarrow x$, then
$\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x_n)=f(x)$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $\epsilon>0$. Well,
    
    $$|f_n(x_n)-f(x)|=|f_n(x_n)-f(x_n)+f(x_n)-f(x)|\leq|f_n(x_n)-f(x_n)|+|f(x_n)-f(x)|$$
    
    Well, since $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ for all $x$, we have that
    $|f_n(x_n)-f(x_n)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Also, we have that $f_n$ is continuous, and since there is
    uniform convergence, then $f$ is also continuous. So, there exists a $\delta$ such that when
    $|x_n-x|<\delta$, then $|f(x_n)-f(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Hence, we see that
    
    $$|f_n(x_n)-f(x_n)|+|f(x_n)-f(x)|<2\frac{\epsilon}{2}=\epsilon$$
    
    Thus, $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x_n)=f(x)$.
