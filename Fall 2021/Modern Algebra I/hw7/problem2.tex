Prove that if $G$ and $H$ are groups with exactly 3 elements each, then $G\cong H$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G$ and $H$ be groups with exactly 3 elements each and let $G$ have operation $*_1$ and $H$ have
    operation $*_2$. So, define $G=\{e_G, g, x\}$, $H=\{e_H, h, y\}$, and $f:G\rightarrow H$ by
    $f(e_G)=e_H$, $f(g)=h$, and $f(x)=y$. Very clearly $f$ is bijective. So,
    
    $$f(e_G*_1e_G)=f(e_G)=e_H=e_H*_2e_H=f(e_G)*_2f(e_G)$$ 
    $$f(e_G*_1g)=f(g)=h=e_H*_2h=f(e_G)*_2f(g)$$
    $$f(e_G*_1x)=f(x)=y=e_H*_2y=f(e_H)*_2f(x)$$
    $$f(g*_1e_G)=f(g)=h=h*_2e_H=f(g)*_2f(e_G)$$
    
    and
    
    $$f(x*_1e_G)=f(x)=y=y*_2e_H=f(x)*_2f(e_G)$$
    
    Now, by homework 3 problem 4, we know that $g*_1g=x$, $h*_2h=y$, $x*_1x=g$, and $y*_2y=h$. Hence
    
    $$f(g*_1g)=f(x)=y=h*_2h=f(g)*_2f(g)$$
    
    and
    
    $$f(x*_1x)=f(g)=h=y*_2y=f(x)*_2f(x)$$
    
    Also, by homework 3 problem 3, we have that $g*_1x=e_G$ and $h*_2y=e_H$ and by problem 1 above, we
    gather that $x*_1g=e_G$ and $y*_2h=e_H$. Therefore
    
    $$f(g*_1x)=f(x*_1g)=f(e_G)=e_H=h*_2y=y*_2h=f(x)*_2f(g)=f(g)*_2f(x)$$
    
    Thus, $G\cong H$ as desired.
