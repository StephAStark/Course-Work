Let $G$ be a group and suppose that $g\in G$ and $g*g=g$. Prove that $g=e$, the identity of $G$.\\

    Let $G$ be a group and assume that $g\in G$ where $g*g=g$. We will show that $g=e$. Well, since $G$
    is a group, there exists an identity element $e$ such that $e*x=x*e=x$ for all $x\in G$. So,
    $g*g=g=e*g$. We can rewrite this as $g*g=e*g$. Now, by cancellation law, we get $g=e$ as desired.
