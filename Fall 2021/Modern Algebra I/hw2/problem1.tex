Determine if each of the following is an operation on their given sets.\\

a. Let $S=\{1\}$ and let $*=+$, the usual addition.\\

b. Let $S=\mathbb{Z}$ and define $*$ by $x*y=1$ if $x+y$ is even and $x*y=-1$ if $x+y$ is odd.\\

c. Let $S=\mathbb{R}$ and define $*$ by $x*y=1$ if $x$ and $y$ are positive and $x*y=1$ if $x$ and $y$
are negative.\\

d. Let $S=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ and define $*$ by
$(a,b)*(c,d)=(\frac{a}{b^2+1},\frac{c}{d^2+1})$.\\

e. Let $S=(0,\infty)$ and define $*$ by $x*y=\pm\sqrt{xy}$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    This is not an operation. $1+1=2\notin S$ which violates condition 3.\\

    This is an operation.\\

    This is not an operation. $0\in\mathbb{R}$, but $0*0$ does not exist since 0 is neither positive or
    negative, violating conditions 1 and 2.\\

    This is an operation.\\

    This is not an operation. This violates the uniqueness condition of an operation.
