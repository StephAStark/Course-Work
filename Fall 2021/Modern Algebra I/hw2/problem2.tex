Determine if each of the following operations are commutative on their given sets.\\

a. Let $S=\mathbb{R}$ and define $*$ on $S$ by $x*y=max(x,y)$.\\

b. Let $S=M_{2\times2}\mathbb{R}$ and define $*$ on $S$ by $A*B=A+B$.\\

c. Let $S=\mathbb{N}$ and define $*$ on $S$ by $x*y=x$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    This operation is commutative.\\

    This operation is commutative.\\

    This operation is not commutative. It takes the first element in the operation and $x$ need not
    equal $y$. For example, if $x=1$ and $y=2$, then $1*2=1\neq 2=2*1$.\\

\end{solution}
