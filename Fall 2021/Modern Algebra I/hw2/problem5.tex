Consider the set $\mathbb{O}$ of odd integers. The usual multiplication is an operation on $\mathbb{O}$.
Prove or disprove that $\mathbb{O}$ is a group under multiplication.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $\mathbb{O}$ be the set of odd integers with the usual multiplication operation. $\mathbb{O}$ is
    not a group under multiplication. We have that $1\in\mathbb{O}$ and clearly $1$ is the identity
    element with respect to multiplication. Now, $3\in\mathbb{O}$ and $\frac13\times3=1$ so $\frac13$ is
    the inverse of $3$, however $\frac13\notin\mathbb{O}$. So the inverse axiom is violated, and
    $\mathbb{O}$ is not a group.
