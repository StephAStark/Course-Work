Let $X=\{1, 2, 3\}$, and consider the group $S_X$ of all bijective functions $f:X\rightarrow X$. Find
functions $f,g\in S_X$ for which $f\circ g\neq g\circ f$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $X=\{1,2,3\}$, $S_X$ be the group of all bijective functions from $X$ into $X$, and let
    $f,g\in S_X$. Define $f:X\rightarrow X$ by $f(1)=2$, $f(2)=3$, and $f(3)=1$ and define
    $g:X\rightarrow X$ by $g(1)=3$, $g(2)=2$, and $g(3)=1$. Clearly, both $f$ and $g$ are bijective.
    Now, $(f\circ g)(1)=f(g(1))=f(3)=1$ and $(g\circ f)(1)=g(f(1))=g(2)=2$ and so we see that we found
    bijective functions $f$ and $g$ such that $f\circ g\neq g\circ f$ as desired.
