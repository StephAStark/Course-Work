Let $X$ be a set. Show that the function $\epsilon:X\rightarrow X$ defined by $\epsilon_X(x)=x$ is a
bijection.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $X$ and $\epsilon$ be as given. We will show first that $\epsilon_X$ is one-to-one, then that
    $\epsilon_X$ is onto. So, first let $x,y\in X$, and assume $\epsilon_X(x)=\epsilon_X(y)$. Then,
    $x=y$, so $\epsilon_X$ is injective. Now, let $y\in X$. Let $x=y$. Hence, $\epsilon_X(x)=x=y$ and
    thus $\epsilon_X$ is also surjectice and therefore is bijective.
