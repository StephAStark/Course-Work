a. Prove that the function $\varphi:(\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R}),+)\rightarrow(\mathbb{R},+)$ defined by
$\varphi(f)=f(c)$ for a fixed constant real number $c$, which is a homomorphism, is surjective.\\

b. With $\varphi$ as above and with $c=0$, what is the kernel of $\varphi$?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $\varphi$ be as given, and let $c\in\mathbb{R}$ be fixed. Let $y\in\mathbb{R}$. Take
    $f(x)\in\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R})$ defined by $f(x)=x+(-c+y)$. Then
    $\varphi(f)=f(c)=c+(-c+y)=(c+-c)+y=0+y=y$. Thus $\varphi$ is surjective.\\

    The kernel of $\varphi$ is $Ker(\varphi)=\{$All functions such that $f(0)=0\}$

\end{solution}
