Prove that the alternating group $A_n$ is a normal subgroup of $S_n$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $g\in A_n$ and $f\in S_n$. Since $S_n$ is a group, $f^{-1}$ exists. Now, assume that $f$ is an
    even permutation. Then, $f^{-1}$ is also an even permutation. So, $f\circ g\circ f^{-1}$ is the
    composition of 3 even permutations. Hence $f\circ g\circ f^{-1}$ is an even permuation, and so
    $f\circ g\circ f^{-1}\in A_n$. On the other hand, assume that $f$ is an odd permutation. Then,
    $f^{-1}$ is also an odd permutation. So, $f\circ g\circ f^{-1}$ is the composition of an odd, an
    even, and another odd permutation. Well, the composition of an odd and an even permutation is odd,
    so then the composition of two odd permutations is then even. So $f\circ g\circ f^{-1}$ is an even
    permutation and $f\circ g\circ f^{-1}\in A_n$. Thus, $A_n$ is a normal subgroup of $S_n$.
