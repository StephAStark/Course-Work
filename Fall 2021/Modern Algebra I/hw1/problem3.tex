Translate the following into symbolic logic:\\

a. Mary is friends with everyone.\\

b. Mary is friends with some student.\\

c. There is exactly one student.\\

d. John is friends with everyone that Steve is friends with.\\

e. No student has a friend.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    $\forall xF(Mary,x)$\\

    $\exists x(F(Mary,x)\land S(x))$\\

    $\exists x\forall y(S(x)\land S(y)\rightarrow x=y)$\\

    $\forall x(F(Steve,x)\rightarrow F(John,x))$\\

    $\forall x\forall y(S(x)\rightarrow (\neg F(x,y)))$

\end{solution}
