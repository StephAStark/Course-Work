Find common domains for the variables such that the given logical statements are true and domains such
that they are false.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    a. A common domain for $x$ and $y$ such that $\exists x\exists yP(x,y)$ is true is
    $D=\mathbb{R}^{+}\cup\{0\}$. A common domain for $x$ and $y$ such that $\exists x\exists yP(x,y)$ is
    false is $D=\mathbb{R}^{-}$.\\

    b. A common domain for $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $\exists x\exists y\forall zQ(x,y,z)$ is true is
    $D=\{0\}$. A common domain for $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $\exists x\exists y\forall zQ(x,y,z)$ is
    false is $D=\mathbb{R}\backslash {0}$.\\

    c. A common domain for $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $\forall x\exists y\exists zQ(x,y,z)$ is true is
    $D=\mathbb{R}^{+}\cup \{0\}$. A common domain for $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that
    $\forall x\exists y\exists zQ(x,y,z)$ is false is $D=\mathbb{R}^{-}$.
