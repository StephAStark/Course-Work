Negate and prove $\forall n\in \mathbb{Z}$($n$ is even $\lor n$ is odd)  Negation: 
$\exists n\in \mathbb{Z}$($n$ is odd $\land n$ is even)\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Show that no integer is both even and odd. Assume by way of contradiction that there is an integer
    $n$ that is both even and odd. So, $n=2k$ where $k$ is some integer. Also, $n=2j+1$ where $j$ is
    some integer. Hence, $2k=2j+1$. Divde both sides by $2$ to get $k=j+\frac{1}{2}$. Now subtract $j$
    from both sides. So, we have $k-j=\frac{1}{2}$. However, by assumption 2, since $k$ and $j$ are
    integers, $k-j$ is an integer contradicting $k-j=\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, no integer is both even and
    odd.
