Let $G$ be a finite group. Prove that every $g\in G$ has finite order, that is, for every $g\in G$,
there is a positive integer $n$ such that the order of $g$ is $n$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G$ be as given above. Let $g\in G$ be arbitrary. Assume by way of contradiction that $g$ has
    infinite order. So, by Theorem, we have that $g^n$ is unique for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. Since
    $g^n\in G$ for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, we have a that $G$ is an infinite group, whcih is a
    contradiction. Since $g$ was arbitrary, we have that every $g\in G$ has finite order.
