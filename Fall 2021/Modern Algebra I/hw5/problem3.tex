Let $G$ be a group and let $g\in G$. Suppose that $g$ has order $n$ for some positive odd integer $n$.
Prove that $g^2$ also has order $n$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G$ and $g$ be as given above. Suppose that $g$ has order $n=2k+1$ for some nonnegative integer
    $k$. We will show that $g^2$ also has order $n$. Well, by Theorem, we have that $g^2$ has order
    $\frac{n}{d}$ where $d=gcd(n,2)$. Since $n$ is odd, $n$ is not divisible by $2$, and since $2$ is
    prime, we have that $d=1$. Therefore, $g^2$ has order $\frac{n}{1}=n$ as desired.
