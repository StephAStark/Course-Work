Let $G$ be as given in 3. Prove that $x*x=y$\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let the group $G$ be as given above along with identity element $e$. We must show that $x*x=y$.
    Assume by way of contradiction that $x*x\neq y$. Then either $x*x=x$ or $x*x=e$. If $x*x=x$, we get
    $x*x=x*e$ by definition of $e$. So, by Cancellation Law, this yields $x=e$ which contradicts the
    definition of $G$. Now, if $x*x=e$, then we get $x*x=x*y$ by 3 above. Again by Cancellation Law, we
    arrive at $x=y$ which also contradicts the definition of $G$. Thus, $x*x=y$ as desired.
