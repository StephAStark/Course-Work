1. Consider the group $(\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R}),+)$. Prove that if $f\in\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R})$ is such
that $f+f=e$, then $f=e$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $(\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R}),+)$ be as given and let $f\in\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R})$ such that
    $f+f=e$ where $e$ is the identity element of $\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R})$. We will show that $f=e$.
    Well, since $\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R})$ is a group, the identity element exists such that $e+f=f+e=f$
    for all $f\in\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R})$. So, we have $f+f=f+e$, and by Cancellation Law, we get $f=e$
    as desired.
