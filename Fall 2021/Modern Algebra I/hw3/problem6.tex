Let $G$ be a group and let $g\in G$. Prove that for every natural number $m$ and every natural number
$n$, we have $g^{m+n}=g^m*g^n$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G$ be a group, $g\in G$, and let $m\in\mathbb{N}$ be fixed. Now let $n\in\mathbb{N}$. First set
    $n=0$. Then $g^{m+n}=g^{m+0}=g^m=g^m*e=g^m*g^0=g^m*g^n$. Now let $n\geq0$ and assume
    $g^{m+n}=g^m*g^n$. Now, take $g^m*g^{n+1}$. By definition, $g^m*g^{n+1}=g^m*(g^n*g)$. By
    assiciativity of $*$ on $G$, we have $g^m*(g^n*g)=(g^m*g^n)*g$ and by assumption
    $(g^m*g^n)*g=g^{m+n}*g$. By definition and associativity of $+$ on $\mathbb{N}$,
    $g^{m+n}*g=g^{(m+n)+1}=g^{m+(n+1)}$. Since $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ were arbitrary,
    $g^{m+n}=g^m*g^n$ for all $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$.
