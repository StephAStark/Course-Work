Let $G$ be a group with exactly three distinct elements; say $G=\{e,x,y\}$, where $e$ is the identity
element of $G$. Prove that $x*y=e$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G=\{e,x,y\}$ be a group where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. We will show that $x*y=e$.
    Assume by way of contradiction that $x*y\neq e$. Then, since $*$ is an operation on $G$, we have
    that either $x*y=x$ or $x*y=y$. If $x*y=x$, then by $e$ being the identity of $G$, we have that
    $x*y=x*e$. So, by the Cancellation Law, we get that $y=e$ which is a contradiction. On the other
    hand, if $x*y=y$, again by the identity element $e$ of $G$, we get $x*y=e*y$. Hence, by Cancellation
    Law, we get $x=e$ which is also a contradiction. So, since $*$ is an operation on $G$, we get that
    $x*y=e$ as desired.
