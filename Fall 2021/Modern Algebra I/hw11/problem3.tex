Show that the only subgroup of $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ which contains both 2 and 3 is $\mathbb{Z}$. So now what
is $\langle2,3\rangle$?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, asssume by way of contradiction that $H$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ that contains 2 and 3.
    Then, $0,-2,-3\in H$. So, since $H$ is a group, $3+(-2)=1\in H$. Now, since $1\in H$, $n1=n\in H$
    for $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ since $H$ is closed under addition. Thus $H=\mathbb{Z}$. Since $H$ was
    arbitrary, $\mathbb{Z}$ is the only subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ that contains 2 and 3. Therefore
    $\langle2,3\rangle=\mathbb{Z}$.
