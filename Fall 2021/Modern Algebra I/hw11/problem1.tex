Show that if $G$ is a group and $\mathcal{F}$ is a nonempty collection of subgroups of $G$, then
$\bigcap\mathcal{F}$ is closed under inverses.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G$ and $\mathcal{F}$ be as given. Let $x\in\bigcap\mathcal{F}$ and let $H\in\mathcal{F}$. Then,
    we have that $x\in H$. Since $x\in H$, there exists $x^{-1}\in H$ such that $xx^{-1}=x^{-1}x=e$.
    Now, since $H$ was arbitrary, we have that $\bigcap\mathcal{F}$ is closed under inverses.
