Let $G$ be a group and $S$ a subset of $G$. Show that if $H$ is any subgroup of $G$ for which
$S\subseteq H$, then $\langle S\rangle\subseteq H$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G$ and $S$ be as given. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ such that $S\subseteq H$. Let
    $x\in\langle S\rangle$. Since $H$ is arbitrary and $S\subseteq H$, by definition $x\in H$. Thus
    $\langle S\rangle\subseteq H$.

\end{solution}
