Let $G$ be a group and $S$ a subset of $G$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the collection of all subgroups of $G$
which contain $S$ as a subset. Prove that $\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty, and moreover
$S\subseteq\bigcap\mathcal{F}$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G, S$, and $\mathcal{F}$ be as given. Clearly, $G$ is a subgroup of itself and $S\subseteq G$,
    so $\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty. Now, let $x\in S$ and $H\in\mathcal{F}$. Then, $x\in H$. Since $H$ is
    arbitrary, we have that $x\in\bigcap\mathcal{F}$. Thus, $S\subseteq\bigcap\mathcal{F}$.
