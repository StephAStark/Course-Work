Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. Further, let $h\in H$. Prove that for every
$m\in\mathbb{Z}$, $h^m\in H$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G$ and $H$ be as given and let $h\in H$ and $m\in\mathbb{Z}$. Now, since $h^0=e$ and $H$ is a
    subgroup of $G$, $h^0\in H$. Now, let $m=1$. Then $h^m=h^1=h\in H$. Now, let $m>1$ and assume that
    $h^m\in H$. Then $h^{m+1}=h^mh^1$. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, and $h^m,h\in H$, we have that
    $h^{m+1}=h^mh^1=h^mh\in H$. So, $h^m\in H$ for every positive integer $m$. Now, since $H$ is a
    subgroup of $G$, $H$ is closed under inverses. So, for every $m\in\mathbb{Z}+$,
    $h^mh^{-m}=h^{m-m}=h^0=e$, and thus the inverse of $h^m$ is $h^{-m}$ for every positive integer $m$.
    Thus $h^{-m}\in H$. Therefore $h^m\in H$ for all $m\in\mathbb{Z}$.
