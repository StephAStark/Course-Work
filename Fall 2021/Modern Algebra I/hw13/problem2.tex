Prove the following: If $G$ is an abelian group of order 1, and $p$ is a prime factor of 1, then $G$ as
an element of order $p$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G$ and $p$ be as given. Well, since $p$ is a prime number, $p>1$ and since $p|1$, it is
    vacuously true that $G$ has an element of order $p$.

\end{solution}
