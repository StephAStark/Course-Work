Let $G$ be a group and suppose $g\in G$ is a nonidentity element such that $g^p=e$ for some prime number
$p$. Prove that $g$ has order $p$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G, g$, and $p$ be as given. Assume by way of contradiction that $g$ has order $n<p$. Then, we
    have that $n$ is a factor of $p$. Since $p$ is prime $n=1$ or $n=p$. Both are a contradiction to our
    assumptions of $g$, so we have that $g$ has order $p$.
