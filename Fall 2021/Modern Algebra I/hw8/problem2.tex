Let $(G,*)$ be a group and let $g,h\in G$. Prove that if $\varphi_g=\varphi_h$, then $g=h$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $G, g$, and $h$ be as given. Assume that $\varphi_g=\varphi_h$. Then $g*x=h*x$ for all
    $x\in G$. Now, by cancellation law, we have that $g=h$ as desired.

\end{solution}
