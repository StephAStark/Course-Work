Compute 'directly' the monoid $M_E$. (First find a set of representatives of the equivalence classes in
$M_E$, then prove that these equivalence classes are distinct).\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Given that the grpah of $E$ has three vertices, we know that we will be dealing with
    $(\mathbb{Z}^{\geq0})^3$. So, $u\mapsto(1,0,0), v\mapsto(0,1,0),$ and $w\mapsto(0,0,1)$. We will mod
    out by $u\mapsto v+u, v\mapsto u+w,$ and $w\mapsto u+v$. That is, we will mod out by:

    $$\mathcal{R}_1:(1,0,0)=(0,1,0)+(0,0,1)=(0,1,1)$$

    $$\mathcal{R}_2:(0,1,0)=(1,0,0)+(0,0,1)=(1,0,1)$$

    and

    $$\mathcal{R}_3:(0,0,1)=(1,0,0)+(0,1,0)=(1,1,0)$$

    By $\mathcal{R}_3$, we have that every element in $M_E$ can be represented with $0$ in the last
    component. Observe

    $$(1,0,0)\mapsto(0,1,1)\mapsto(0,1,0)+(0,0,1)\mapsto(1,0,1)+(1,1,0)$$
    $$\mapsto(1,0,0)+(0,0,1)+(1,0,0)+(0,1,0)\mapsto(1,0,0)+(1,0,0)+(0,0,1)+(0,1,0)$$
    $$\mapsto(1,0,0)+(1,0,0)+(0,1,1)\mapsto(1,0,0)+(1,0,0)+(1,0,0)\mapsto(3,0,0)$$

    Now, by similar operations using the above relations, we get that $1=3$ in all components. So, we
    conclude that $M_E$ consists of the equivalence classes $[(0,0,0)]$, $[(1,0,0)],$
    $[(2,0,0)], [(0,1,0)], [(0,2,0)], [(1,1,0)], [(2,1,0)], [(1,2,0)]$ and $[(2,2,0)]$. Now, let $u=2$,
    $v=1$ and $w=1$. Then we get that $[(1,0,0)]=[(0,2,0)]$, $[(1,1,0)]=[(2,2,0)]$ and
    $[(2,0,0)]=[(1,2,0)]$. Setting up another invariance, let $u=2$, $v=2$, and $w=1$. Then, we get that
    $[(0,1,0)]=[(2,1,0)]$. Hence, we get that $M_E$ consits of exactly the equivalence classes
    $[(0,0,0)]$, $[(1,0,0)],$ $[(2,0,0)], [(0,1,0)]$, and $[(1,1,0)]$. So,
    $M_E=\{0,u,2u,v,u+v|3u=u,3v=v\}$.
