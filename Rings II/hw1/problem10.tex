For $i\geq 3$, let $C_n$ be the graph consisting of $n$ vertices $\{v_1, v_2, \hdots, v_n\}$,  and $2n$ edges 
$\{e_1, e_2, \hdots, e_n, f_1, f_2, \hdots, f_n\}$ for which 

$$s(e_i) = v_i,  \ \  r(e_i) = v_{i+1}, \ \  s(f_i) = v_i,  \ \ r(f_i) = v_{i-1},$$

where indices are interpreted ${\rm mod } \ n$.   (So, for instance, $r(e_n) = e_1$, and $r(f_1) = v_n$.)   In words, $C_n$ 
is the graph with $n$ vertices, where each vertex emits two edges, one to both of its neighboring vertices. In particular, 
$C_3$ is the graph $E$ of the previous problem. For $n=4$, $n=5$, and $n=6$, describe $\mathcal{V}(L_K(C_n))$.  
(Do this by Smith normal form; you need NOT do this directly as in Question 6a.) For two of these three, you will 
be able to use this description of $\mathcal{V}(L_K(C_n))$  to identify $L_K(C_n)$ as a ``known" $K$-algebra.   
(You might need to look at the monoid  $\mathcal{V}(L_K(C_n))$ directly in order to identify $[  L_K(C_n) ]$ within 
$\mathcal{V}(L_K(C_n))$.)  Do that. Can you say anything about $L_K(C_n)$ for the third of these?
