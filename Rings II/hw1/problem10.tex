For $i\geq 3$, let $C_n$ be the graph consisting of $n$ vertices $\{v_1, v_2, \hdots, v_n\}$,  and $2n$
edges $\{e_1, e_2, \hdots, e_n, f_1, f_2, \hdots, f_n\}$ for which 

$$s(e_i) = v_i,  \ \  r(e_i) = v_{i+1}, \ \  s(f_i) = v_i,  \ \ r(f_i) = v_{i-1},$$

where indices are interpreted ${\rm mod } \ n$. (So, for instance, $r(e_n) = e_1$, and $r(f_1) = v_n$.)
In words, $C_n$ is the graph with $n$ vertices, where each vertex emits two edges, one to both of its
neighboring vertices. In particular, $C_3$ is the graph $E$ of the previous problem. For $n=4$, $n=5$,
and $n=6$, describe $\mathcal{V}(L_K(C_n))$. (Do this by Smith normal form; you need NOT do this
directly as in Question 6a.) For two of these three, you will be able to use this description of
$\mathcal{V}(L_K(C_n))$ to identify $L_K(C_n)$ as a "known" $K$-algebra. (You might need to look at the
monoid $\mathcal{V}(L_K(C_n))$ directly in order to identify $[  L_K(C_n) ]$ within 
$\mathcal{V}(L_K(C_n))$.) Do that. Can you say anything about $L_K(C_n)$ for the third of these?\\\\ 

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    So, using either the smithForm or the eig Matlab functions depending on whether the matrix in
    question is singular or not, we get the following Smith Normal Forms corresponding to $n=4$, $n=5$,
    and $n=6$ respectively:

    $$\left(\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
                                0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 \end{array}\right)$$

    $$\left(\begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
                                 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array}\right)$$

    $$\left(\begin{array}{cccccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                                  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
                                  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 \end{array}\right)$$
