Modify/simplify/rewrite the argument given in The Reduction Theorem 2.2.11 of AAS, in the situation where the graph 
is assumed to be of the form $R_n$ (i.e., one vertex, $n$ loops, $n\geq2$). More formally, prove the following.\\
Let $E=R_n$ for some $n\geq2$ (denote the unique vertex by $v$), and let $K$ be an arbitrary field. For any nonzero 
element $\alpha\in L_K(E)$ there exists $\mu,\eta\in Path(E)$ such that $0\neq\mu*\alpha\eta =kv$ in $L_K(E)$, for 
some $0\neq k\in K$.\\\\
