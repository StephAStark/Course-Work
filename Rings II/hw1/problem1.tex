Let $(S,+)$ be an abelian semigroup. Suppose $S$ has the property that for each pair $a,b\in S$ there exists $c\in S$ 
for which $a+c=b$. Prove that $S$ is a group.\\

    %% Still need to show that the identity is unique. Possibly
    Let $S$ be as given above. Let $a,b\in S$. We will show that $S$ is has an identity and is closed under inverses. Assume 
    first that $a=b$. Then, by our assumption of $S$, there exists a $c\in S$ such that $a+c=b=a$. Since $S$ is abelian, we 
    have that $a+c=c+a=a$. Therefore, $S$ has an identity element. To show that the identity is unique, assume that there is 
    more than one. That is, assume there exists $e'$ such that $a+e'=e'+a=a$. Now, let $b=e$ be the identity element. Again, 
    by our assumption, there exists $c'\in S$ such that $a+c'=b=e$. That is $a+c'=c'+a=e$ since $S$ is an abelain semigroup. 
    Thus, $S$ is a group as desired.
