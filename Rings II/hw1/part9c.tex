Find the matrix $I-A_F^t$, and compute its Smith normal form. Show that your answer to (c) is consistent
with your answer to (a).\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Using the relations defined in part a, we have that $A_E$ is given by

    $$\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array}\right)$$

    So

    $$I-A_F^t=\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 0 & -1 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \end{array}\right)$$

    Now, using the builtin smithForm function in Matlab gives an error as the above matrix is singular,
    so we instead use the eig function to get the corresponding eigenvalues of the matrix, and we get
    that the Smith Normal Form for the above matrix is

    $$\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{array}\right)$$

    So, by the Theorem that states that $V(L_K(F))\setminus\{0\}\cong\bigoplus_{m_i}\mathbb{Z}_{m_i}$
    for $m_i$ the $ith$ diagonal component of the Smith Normal Form matrix, we get that
