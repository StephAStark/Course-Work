Prove that if $F$ is a free abelian group (i.e.,free $\mathbb{Z}$-module), and $G$ is a subgroup of $F$,
then $G$ is a free abelian group. (Possible hints: (1) Do the “finitely generated free” case by 
induction; (2) do the general case using Zorn's Lemma, together with what you proved in the finitely
generated case.)\\\\
