A module $_RM$ is finitely cogenerated in case for every $A$ of submodules of $M$ with $\cap A=0$, there
is some finite set $F\subset A$ with $\cap F=0$. A module is artinian in case its lattice $S(M)$ of
submodules satisfies the DCC. Prove for a module $M$, the following are equivalent:\\
(a) M is artinian\\
(b) Every factor module of $M$ is finitely cogenerated\\
(c) Every non-empty set in $S(M)$ has a minimal element.\\\\
