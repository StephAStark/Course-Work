Prove that if $B\subseteq A$ and $B$ is infinite, then $A$ is infinite. Conclude that every subset
of a finite set is finite.\\\\

    Let $A$ and $B$ be sets, and $B\subseteq A$. Let $B$ be infinite. Assume first that $B=A$. Then
    clearly $A$ is infinite. So, assume that $B\subset A$. Now, since $B$ is infinite, there exists an
    injective function $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow B$. So for any $x\in\mathbb{N}$, $f(x)\in B$. Now
    consider the function $g:B\rightarrow A$ defined by $g(x)=x$ since $B\subset A$. Now, let
    $x_1,x_2\in B$ and assume that $g(x_1)=g(x_2)$. Then $x_1=x_2$ and so $g(x)$ is injective. So, by
    above we have that $(g\circ f):\mathbb{N}\rightarrow A$ is injective. Since we have an injective
    function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $A$, we have that $A$ is infinite by definition. Still letting
    $B\subseteq A$, we have that if $A$ is finite, then $B$ is also finite by the contrapositive of the
    above proven statement.
