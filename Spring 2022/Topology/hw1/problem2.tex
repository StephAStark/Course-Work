(\#3 in 2.1) Consider the subset $D$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $D=\{(x,y)|x\leq y^2\}$. Is this set a
Cartesian product of two subsets of $\mathbb{R}$? Explain.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    $D$ is not a cartesian product. Assume by way of contradiction that $D$ is a cartesian product.
    Well, we can see that the points $(1,1)$ and $(0,0)$ are elements of $D$. Since we assume that $D$
    is a cartesian product, we would then have the points $(0,1),(1,0)\in D$. However, $1\nleq 0^2=0$
    which is a contradiction. Therefore, $D$ is not a cartesian product.
