(\#6 in 7.2) Show from the definition that $\mathbb{R}^2_{\mathcal{U}^2}$ is not compact.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Consider the set $\mathcal{C}=\{(x,y)|x^2+y^2<a^2\; \text{such that}\; a\in\mathbb{R}^+\}$. Clearly
    $\mathcal{C}$ is a cover of $\mathbb{R}^2$ as $C\in\mathcal{C}$ is an open disk of radius $a$ and
    $\bigcup_{C\in\mathcal{C}}C=\mathbb{R}^2$. However, there is no finite subcollection from
    $\mathcal{C}$ that covers $\mathbb{R}^2$, since no finite union of open disks with radius
    $a\in\mathbb{R}^+$ covers all of $\mathbb{R}^2$. If there were, then there would have to be a radius
    $a=\infty$ inorder to reach the "ends" of $\mathbb{R}^2$, however $\infty\notin\mathbb{R}^+$. So we
    have that $\mathbb{R}^2_{\mathcal{U}^2}$ is not compact by definition.
