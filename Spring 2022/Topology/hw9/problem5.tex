(\#2 in 7.5) Prove that any finite union of compact subsets of a topological space is compact.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $X_{\tau}$ be a topological space and let $A_1, A_2,\ldots, A_n$ be compact subsets of $X$ for
    some $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an arbitrary open cover for $\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i$. So,
    $\bigcup_{C\in\mathcal{C}}C=\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i$. Then, every $C\in\mathcal{C}$ has the form
    $C=V\cap(\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i)$ where $V$ is $\tau$-open. So,
    $C=(V\cap A_1)\cup(V\cap A_2)\cup\cdots\cup(V\cap A_n)$. Since $V$ is $\tau-$open, $V\cap A_i$ is
    open in $\tau_{A_i}$ for $0\leq i\leq n$. Therefore,
    $\bigcup_{C\in\mathcal{C}}C=V_i\cap(\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i)$. Hence, we can see that $\mathcal{C}$ is
    also an arbitrary open cover for each $A_i$. Since each $A_i$ is compact, each $A_i$ has a finite
    open subcover for $\mathcal{C}$. Let $\mathcal{B}_i$ be such a finite open subcover for $A_i$. Then
    $\bigcup_{B\in\mathcal{B}_i}=A_i$. Thus,
    $\bigcup_{i=1}^n(\bigcup_{B\in\mathcal{B}})=\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i$. Since $\tau$ is a topology, we have
    that $\bigcup_{i=1}^n(\bigcup_{j=1}^{m_i}V_{i_j})$ is open in $\tau$ where $V_{i_j}$ is a
    $\tau$-open set such that $B_{i_j}=V_{i_j}\cap A_i$. Thus,
    $\bigcup_{i=1}^n(\bigcup_{j=1}^{m_i}V_{i_j})\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i$ is open in
    $\tau_{\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i}$. Therefore, $\bigcup_{i=1}^n(\bigcup_{B\in\mathcal{B}})$ is an open
    finite subcover of $\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i$, and since $\mathcal{C}$ was arbitrary, we have that
    $\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i$ is compact as desired.
