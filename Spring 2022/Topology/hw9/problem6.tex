(\#7 in 7.3) Prove the Closed Graph Theorem: If $f: X_{\tau} \to Y_{\nu}$ is continuous, with $Y$ both
compact and Hausdorff, then the graph

$$G_f = \{(x,y) \in X\times Y | y=f(x)\}$$

is closed in $X_{\tau}\times Y_{\nu}$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $X_{\tau}$ and $Y_{\nu}$ be topological spaces with $Y_{\nu}$ compact and Hausdorff and let
    $f:X_{\tau}\rightarrow Y_{\nu}$ be continuous. We will show that $(X\times Y)\setminus G_f$ is open.
    So, let $(x,y)\in(X\times Y)\setminus G_f$. So, for this $(x,y)$, we have that $y\neq f(x)$. Since
    $Y$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint $\nu-$open sets $U,V$ such that $y\in U$ and $f(x)\in V$. Let
    $M_{f(x)}$ be an open neighborhood of $f(x)$. Since $f$ is continuous, there exists a $\tau$-open
    neighborhood, $N_x$, of $x$ such that $N_x\subseteq f^{-1}(M_{f(x)})$. Since
    $y\neq f(x), U\subset Y$ and $(x,y)\in N_x\times U\subset(X\times Y)\setminus G_f$, and since
    $(x,y)\in(X\times Y)\setminus G_f$ was arbitrary, we have that $(X\times Y)\setminus G_f$ is open.
    Thus, $G_f$ is closed in $X\times Y$ as desired.
