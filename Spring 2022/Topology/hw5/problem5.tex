If $p$ is an isolated point of a subset $A$ in a topological space $X_{\tau}$, show that there exists a
$\tau$-open set $U$ such that $U\cap A = \{p\}$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $X_{\tau}$ be a topological space and let $A\subseteq X_{\tau}$ with $p$ an isolated point of
    $A$. By definition, $p\notin A'$. Then $p\notin\{x|$for all neighborhoods $N_x$ of
    $x, (N_x\setminus\{x\})\cap A\neq\emptyset\}$. That is, there exists a neighborhood, $N_p$, of $p$
    such that $(N_p\setminus\{p\})\cap A=\emptyset$. By definition of neighborhood,
    $N_p$ is $\tau-$open. Thus, there exists a $\tau-$open set, $N_p$, such that $N_p\cap A=\{p\}$
    as desired.
