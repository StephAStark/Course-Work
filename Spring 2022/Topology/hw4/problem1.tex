(\#3 in 3.4) Prove that if $A\subseteq X$ is $\tau$-open, then any $\tau_{A}$-open set is also
$\tau$-open.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $A\subseteq X$ be $\tau-$open. Let $U$ be any $\tau_{A}-$open set. Then $U=A\cap V$ for some
    $V\in\tau$. Since $A$ is $\tau-$open, $U$ is the intersection of $\tau-$open sets. Since $\tau$ is a
    topology, $U\in\tau$ and is thus $\tau-$open. Since $U$ was an arbitrary $\tau_{A}-$open set, any
    $\tau_{A}-$open set is $\tau-$open as desired.
