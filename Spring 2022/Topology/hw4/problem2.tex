State and prove an analogous statement about closed sets.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    If $A\subseteq X$ is $\tau-$closed, then any $\tau_{A}-$closed set is also $\tau-$closed.\\

    Let $A\subseteq X$ be $\tau-$closed. Let $U$ be an arbitrary $\tau_{A}-$closed set. By
    theorem 3.4.2, we have that $U=A\cap K$ for some $K\subseteq X$ such that $K$ is $\tau-$closed.
    Since $A$ is $\tau-$closed, $U$ is the intersection of $\tau-$closed sets, and is therefore
    $\tau$-closed. Since $U$ was arbitrary, we have that any $\tau_{A}-$closed set is $\tau-$closed.
