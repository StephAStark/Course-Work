(\#1 in 5.4) Sketch some open sets in the quotient space $\mathbb{R}/\sim$ of Example 5.2.
(If you are writing your solutions in LaTeX, you may sketch these on paper, scan and email them to me,
or upload in Canvas as a second file). Be sure to show that the sets in $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{U}}$
that project to these sets under the quotient map $\nu: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}/\sim$.\\\\

    For ease of writing, we will denote the projection of an interval $(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}$ by $([a],[b])$.
