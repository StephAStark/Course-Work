(\#1 in 5.5) A \textit{path} in a space $X_{\tau}$ is a continuous function
$\alpha:[0,1]_{\mathcal{U}}\to X_{\tau}$. If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two paths in $X_{\tau}$ such that
$\alpha(1) = \beta(0)$, then the map $\alpha \star \beta:[0,1]\to X$ defined by

\[(\alpha \star \beta)(t)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                                    \alpha(2t) & \mbox{$0\leq t\leq 1/2$}\\
                                    \beta(2t-1)      & \mbox{$1/2 \leq t\leq 1$}
                                    \end{array}
                          \right. \]

 is continuous. (\textit{Hint}: Draw two such paths, then consider the Pasting Lemma.)\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $X_{\tau}$ be a topological space and let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be as given. Let
    $(\alpha\star\beta)$ be as stated above. Well, we have that $2t$ from $[0,\frac12]$ to $[0,1]$ and
    $2t-1$ from $[\frac12,1]$ to $[0,1]$ are both polynomials, and are therefore both continuous. Hence
    $\alpha(2t)$ and $\beta(2t-1)$ are both continuous. Now by the definition of $(\alpha\star\beta)$
    above, define $A=[0,\frac12]$ and $B=[\frac12,1]$. We can seee that $A\cup B=[0,1]$, and $A$ and $B$
    are both closed in $[0,1]$. Now, $A\cap B=\{\frac12\}$ and so
    $\alpha(2(\frac12))=\alpha(1)=\beta(0)=\beta(2(\frac12)-1)$ by definition. Thus, by the Pasting
    Lemma, we have that $(\alpha\star\beta)$ is continuous as desired.\\
