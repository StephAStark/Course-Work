Let $X=X_1\times X_2\times \cdots \times X_n$ be a product of topological spaces. Define an equivalence
relation $\sim$ on $X$ by declaring that $(x_1, x_2, \ldots,x_n)\sim (y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n)$ if and only
if $x_1 = y_1$. Show that $X/\sim$ is homeomorphic to $X_1$.\\\\

    Let $\tau_1, \tau_2,\ldots, \tau_n$ be topologies on $X_1, X_2,\ldots, X_n$ respectively such that
    they are the topologies considered in $X$. Consider the function $f:X/\sim\rightarrow X_1$ defined
    by $f([(x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n)])=x_1$. Now, let
    $[(x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n)],[(y_1, y_2,\ldots, y_n)]\in X/\sim$ and assume that
    $f([(x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n)])=f([(y_1, y_2,\ldots, y_n)])$. Then, $x_1=y_1$ and by definition,
    $(x_1, x_2, \ldots,x_n)\sim (y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n)$. Hence
    $[(x_1, x_2, \ldots,x_n)]=[(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n)]$ and $f$ is injective. Now, let $x_1\in X_1$. Then
    there exists $[(x_1, x_2,\ldots x_n)]\in X/\sim$ such that $f([(x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n)])=x_1$ by
    definition of $X$ and $X/\sim$. So, $f$ is also onto and therefore bijective. Now, let $U$ be an
    open set in $X_1$. Now, $(f\circ\nu)^{-1}(U)=\nu^{-1}(f^{-1}(U))$. Now, for every
    $(x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n)\in\nu^{-1}(f^{-1}(U))$, we have that
    $(x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n)\in U\times X_2\times\cdots\times X_n\subseteq\nu^{-1}(f^{-1}(U))$, and so
    $\nu^{-1}(f^{-1}(U))$ is open in $X$. Therefore, we have that $f$ is continuous. Now, let $U$ be an
    open set in $X/\sim$. So, $\nu^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. That is, for every
    $(x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n)\in\nu^{-1}(U)$ there exists
    $V_1\times V_2\times\cdots\times V_n\in\tau_1\times\tau_2\times\cdots\times\tau_n$ such that
    $(x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n)\in V_1\times V_2\times\cdots\times V_n\subseteq\nu^{-1}(U)$. Since,
    $f(U)=V_1$ and since $V_1$ is open in $X_1$, we have that $f$ is also an open map. Therefore, $f$ is
    a homeomorphism. Thus, $X/\sim\cong X_1$ as desired.
