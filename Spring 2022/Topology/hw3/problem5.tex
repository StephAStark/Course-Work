Suppose that $X$ is any set and that $\tau$ and $\sigma$ are topologies on $X$. If $A\subseteq X$,
denote the closure of $A$ with respect to $\tau$ by $\text{Cl}_{\tau} (A)$ and the closure of $A$ with
respect to $\sigma$ by $\text{Cl}_{\sigma} (A)$. That is, $\text{Cl}_{\tau} (A)$ is the smallest
$\tau$-closed set containing $A$, and $\text{Cl}_{\sigma} (A)$ is the smallest $\sigma$-closed set
containing $A$.\\
Prove that if $\tau$ is finer than $\sigma$, then
$\text{Cl}_{\tau} (A)\subseteq \text{Cl}_{\sigma} (A)$.\\\\


\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $X$ be a set with topologies $\tau$ and $\sigma$. Let $A\subseteq X$, and assume that $\tau$ is
    finer than $\sigma$. That is $\sigma\subseteq\tau$. Well, Cl$_{\sigma}(A)=Y$ such that
    $Y\subseteq X$, $Y$ is $\sigma-$closed, and $A\subseteq Y$. Since $Y$ is $\sigma-$closed, we have
    that $X\setminus Y$ is $\sigma-$open. That is, $X\setminus Y\in\sigma$. So, $X\setminus Y\in\tau$
    and is $\tau-$open. Hence, $Y$ is a $\tau-$closed set that contains $A$. Thus,
    Cl$_{\tau}(A)\subseteq Y=$Cl$_{\sigma}(A)$.
