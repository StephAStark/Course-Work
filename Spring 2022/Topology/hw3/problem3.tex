Find the closure and the interior of the interval [1,3] in $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$.\\\\


\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, Cl$([1,3])$ is the smallest subset $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$ such that $A$ is
    closed and $[1,3]\subseteq A$. Now, Cl$([1,3])=\mathbb{R}$. Assume by way of contradiction that
    there exists $X\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that $[1,3]\subseteq X$ and $X$ is closed in
    $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$. Then $\mathbb{R}\setminus X$ is open in $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$ and
    so $X$ is finite. This is a contradiction though since there is no finite set $X$ such that
    $[1,3]\subseteq X$. Next, Int$([1,3])$ is the largest open subset of $[1,3]$. So,
    Int$([1,3])=\emptyset$. Assume by way of contradiction that there exists an open set
    $X\subseteq[1,3]$ such that $X\neq\emptyset$ and $X$ is open in $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$ Then
    $\mathbb{R}\setminus X$ is finite. However, even if $X=[1,3]$, $\mathbb{R}\setminus X$ would not be
    finite. Hence, there exists no nonempty subset $X$ of $[1,3]$ such that $X$ is open in
    $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$.
