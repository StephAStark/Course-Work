Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, and let $f:X\to Y$ be any function. Show that the following two
conditions are equivalent:\\
If $U$ is open in $Y$, then $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.\\
If $F$ is closed in $Y$, then $f^{-1}(F)$ is closed in $X$.\\\\

    First we will show that for any two sets $A$ and $B$ and function $f:A\rightarrow B$, if
    $C\subseteq B$, then $f^{-1}(B\setminus C)=A\setminus f^{-1}(C)$. So, let $A,B$ be sets and
    $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a function. Let $C\subseteq B$. Now, let $x\in f^{-1}(B\setminus C)$. Then by
    definition of inverse image, $x\in A$ such that $f(x)\in B\setminus C$. Hence $f(x)\in B$ and
    $f(x)\notin C$. So, by definition of preimage, $x\in A$ and $x\notin f^{-1}(C)$. So,
    $x\in A\setminus f^{-1}(C)$ and $f^{-1}(B\setminus C)\subseteq A\setminus f^{-1}(C)$. Next, let
    $x\in A\setminus f^{-1}(C)$. Then $x\in A$ and $x\notin f^{-1}(C)$. So, by definition
    $f(x)\notin C$. Therefore $f(x)\in B$ and $f(x)\notin C$. So, $f(x)\in B\setminus C$. That is
    $x\in f^{-1}(B\setminus C)$. Thus $f^{-1}(B\setminus C)=A\setminus f^{-1}(C)$ by double inclusion.\\
    
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, and let $f:X\to Y$ be any function. Assume that if $U$ is
    open in $Y$, then $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Now, assume that $F$ is closed in $Y$. Then we have
    that $Y\setminus F$ is open in $Y$. So, $f^{-1}(Y\setminus F)$ is open in $X$ by our assumption.
    Since $f^{-1}(Y\setminus F)=X\setminus f^{-1}(F)$ by above, $X\setminus f^{-1}(F)$ is open, and so
    by definition, we have that $f^{-1}(F)$ is closed in $X$. Now, assume that if $F$ is closed in $Y$,
    then $f^{-1}(F)$ is closed in $X$. So, assume that $U$ is open in $Y$. Since $U$ is open, we have
    that $Y\setminus U$ is closed in $Y$. Then by supposition, $f^{-1}(Y\setminus U)$ is closed in $X$.
    Now $f^{-1}(Y\setminus U)=X\setminus f^{-1}(U)$ by what we showed above, so $X\setminus f^{-1}(U)$
    is closed in $X$. Thus, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Therefore statement 'a' is logically equivalent
    to statement 'b' as desired.
