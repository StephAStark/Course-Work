(\#2 in 3.3) Prove that no nonempty proper subset of $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$ is simultaneously open
and closed.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $A\subset\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$ be such that $A\neq\emptyset$. Assume by way of
    contradiction that $A$ is both open and closed in $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$. Since $A$ is open, we
    have that $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$ and therefore $A$ is infinite by definition. So,
    $\mathbb{R}\setminus A$ is finite since $A$ is nonempty. Since $A$ is closed, we have that
    $\mathbb{R}\setminus A$ is open. That is $\mathbb{R}\setminus A\in\mathcal{FC}$. So,
    $\mathbb{R}\setminus(\mathbb{R}\setminus A)=A$ is finite since $A\neq\mathbb{R}$. However, this
    contradicts $A\in\mathcal{FC}$ and $A$ being infinite. Since $A$ was an arbitrary nonempty proper
    subset, we have that no such subset of $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{FC}}$ is both open and closed.
