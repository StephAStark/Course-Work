(\#6 in 6.4) Prove that if $X_{\tau}$ is path-connected and $\tau' \subseteq \tau$, then $X_{\tau'}$ is
also path-connected.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $X_{\tau}$ be path-connected and let $\tau'\subseteq\tau$. Then, for every pair of points
    $x_0,x_1\in X$, there exists a continuous function $\alpha:[0,1]\rightarrow X_{\tau}$ with
    $\alpha(0)=x_0$ and $\alpha(1)=x_1$. Since $\tau'\subseteq\tau$, we have that
    $\alpha:[0,1]\rightarrow X_{\tau'}$ is also continuous. Hence, for every pair of points
    $x_0,x_1\in X$, there exists a path $\alpha:[0,1]\rightarrow X_{\tau'}$ with $\alpha(0)=x_0$ and
    $\alpha(1)=x_1$. Therefore, $X_{\tau'}$ is also path-connected as desired.
