Let $X_{\tau}$ be a space with the property that given any $x\in X$ and any neighborhood $U$ of $x$,
there is a neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that Cl($V$) is a proper subset of $U$.\\
Give an example that shows that $X$ need not be connected.\\
If we add the condition that for every $x\in X$ and every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ there is a connected
neighborhood $V_x$ of $x$ such that $x\in V_x\subseteq \text{Cl($V_x$)}\subseteq U$, is this sufficient
to make $X$ connected? Explain.\\\\

    Consider the set $X=(0,1)\cup(2,3)$ as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology. As we can
    see, $X$ is disconnected by $(0,1)$ and $(2,3)$. Now, let $x\in X$. Without loss of generality, let
    $x\in(0,1)$, and let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $x$. Then in general $U=(a,1)\cup(2,b)$ where
    $0\leq a<x<b\leq3$ or $U=(a,b)$ where $0\leq a<x<b\leq1$ or $2\leq a<x<b\leq3$. Now, by the
    continuity properties of $\mathbb{R}$, we have $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{R}$ such that
    $0<a<\alpha<x<\beta<1$. Then $V=(\alpha,\beta)$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ with
    Cl$(V)=[\alpha,\beta]\subset U$. So, $X$ satisfies the above properties and is disconnected. In
    particular, let $x=\frac12$. Then, let $U=(\frac14,\frac34)$ which is an open neighborhood of
    $\frac12$. Now, we have $V=(\frac38,\frac58)$ is also an open neighborhood of $\frac12$, and
    Cl$(V)=[\frac38,\frac58]\subset U$, but $X$ is still disconnected.\\

    Well, if we let $X$ be the same set as above, we see that $V=(\alpha,\beta)$ as given above is
    connected, so $X$ still satisfies the desired propperties, but $X$ is still disconnected. However,
    if we require that for any $x\in X$ and any neighborhood $U$ of $x$, if every open neighborhood $V$
    of $x$ such that $x\in V\subseteq$Cl$(V)\subset U$, $V$ is connected, and for all open neighborhoods
    $V$ of $x$, the arbitrary intersection of them is nonempty, then this would be a sufficient
    condition for $X$ to be connected.
