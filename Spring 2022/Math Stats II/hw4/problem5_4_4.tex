A sample of size $n=16$ is drawn from a normal distribution where $\sigma=10$ but $\mu$ is unknown. If
$\mu=20$, what is the probability that the estimator $\hat{\mu}=Y$ will lie between 19.0 and 21.0?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, the probability is given by
    
    $$P(19\leq X\leq21)=P(19-20\leq X-20\leq21-20)=P(\frac{19-20}{10/4}\leq Z\leq\frac{21-20}{10/4})$$
    $$=P(-0.4\leq Z\leq0.4)=0.3108$$
    
    So, the probability is $0.3108$ or $31.08\%$.

\end{solution}
