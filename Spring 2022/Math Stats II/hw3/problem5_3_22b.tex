Construct the confidence interval assuming that the towns population is 3000.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Assuming the same sample proportion $\hat{p}=.36$ and confidence level $z=1.64$, we have that the
    confidence interval is
    $[.36-1.64(\sqrt{\frac{.36(1-.36)}{3000}}),.36+1.64(\sqrt{\frac{.36(1-.36)}{3000}})]=
    [0.3456,0.3744]$.

\end{solution}
