If the standard deviation $\sigma$ associated with the pdf that produced the following sample is 3.6,
would it be correct to claim that
$(2.61-1.96*\frac{3.6}{\sqrt{20}},2.61+1.96*\frac{3.6}{\sqrt{20}})=(1.03, 4.19)$ is a $95\%$ confidence
interval for $\mu$?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    The given interval and standard deviation are calculated correctly given the data, but the given
    data does not appear to be normal. That is, the data does not seem to fit a normal distribution, as
    it is very left scewed. So, claiming that the $95\%$ confidence interval is for $\mu$ would be
    incorrect.

\end{solution}
