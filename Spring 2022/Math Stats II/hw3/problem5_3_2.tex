In persons with no lung dysfunction, the norm for $FEV_1/VC$ ratios is 0.80. Based on the data (175) of
19 workers, is it believable that exposure to the Bacillus subtilis enzyme has no effect on the
$FEV_1/VC$ ratio? Answer the question by constructing a $95\%$ confidence interval. Assume that
$FEV_1/VC$ ratios are normally distributed with $\sigma=0.09$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, based off the data, we have that $n=19$, and $\bar{x}=.76632$. Since we want a $95\%$
    confidence interval, we have that the z-score is 1.96. SO, the confidence interval is given by
    $[.76632-1.96(\frac{.09}{\sqrt{19}}),.76632+1.96(\frac{.09}{\sqrt19})]=[0.7259,0.8068]$. So, we are
    $95\%$ confident the population mean is within this interval. So, it is believable to assume that
    the enzime has little to no effect on the $FEV_1/VC$ ratio.
