A public health official is planning for the supply of influenza vaccine needed for the upcoming flu
season. She took a poll of 350 local citizens and found that only 126 said they would be vaccinated.
Find the $90\%$ confidence interval for the true proportion of people who plan to get the vaccine.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, since we want a $90\%$ confidence interval, the z-score is $1.64$. Now, the sample proportion
    is $\hat{p}=\frac{126}{350}=0.36$. So, the interval is given by
    $[.36-1.64(\sqrt{\frac{.36(1-.36)}{350}}),.36+1.64(\sqrt{\frac{.36(1-.36)}{350}})]=[0.3179,0.4021]$.
    So, we are $90\%$ confident the true population proportion is within $[0.3179, 0.4021]$.
