Suppose a sample of size $n$ is to be drawn from a normal distribution where $\sigma$ is known to be
14.3. How large does n have to be to guarantee that the length of the $95\%$ confidence interval for
$\mu$ will be less than 3.06?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    The margin of error for a normal distribution is given by $d=z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
    Hence $n=\frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2\sigma^2}{d^2}$. Since we want the interval to be no bigger than
    $3.06$, we have that $d=\frac{3.06}{2}=1.53$. So, $n=\frac{1.96^214.3^2}{1.53^2}=335.58$. So, we
    need $n\geq336$ for the interval to be no bigger than $3.06$.

\end{solution}
