What, if anything, is unusual about the following residual plots in the book?\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, the residuals in the first plot are all positive, so there may be a pattern. The residuals in
    the second plot alternate from positive to negative with each $x-$value, indicating a pattern. So,
    from both of the residual data plots, and the possible patterns, we can conclude that a straight
    line would likely not fit the data for both of them.
