The following is the residual plot that results from fitting the equation $y=6.0+2.0x$ to a set of
$n=10$ points. What, if anything, would be wrong with predicting that $y$ will equal 30.0 when
$x=12$?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, the value $x=12$ is outside of the observed data on the residual plot, so we can't say whether
    or not the residuals continue to be random past about $x=8.5$. That is we cannot say for certain
    that $(12,30)$ would be an appropriate fit for the data.
