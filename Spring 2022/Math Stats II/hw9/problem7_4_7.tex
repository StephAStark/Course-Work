Construct a $90\%$ confidence interval for the true average absorption rate for a sample size of 20.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, the data gives us an average of $\bar{x}=1.427$ and a sample standard deviation of
    $s=0.05639$. Now, we need $-t_{0.05}$ and $t_{0.05}$. Since $n=20$ we have 19 degrees of freedom and
    so $-t_{0.05}=-1.7291$ and $t_{0.05}=1.7291$. Thus, the $90\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$ is

    $$[1.427-1.7291*\frac{0.05639}{\sqrt{20}},1.427+1.7291*\frac{0.05639}{\sqrt{20}}]=[1.4052,1.4488]$$

\end{solution}
