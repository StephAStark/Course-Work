Assume that match lengths are normally distributed. Use Theorem 7.5.1 to construct a $95\%$ confidence
interval for the standard deviation of the match lengths.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, the data gives us a sample size of $n=16$, an average of $\bar{x}=94.625$, and a sample
    standard deviation of $s=27.2467$. Now, we have 15 degrees of freedom, so $\chi^2_{0.025}=6.262$ and
    $\chi^2_{0.975}=27.488$. Thus, by Theorem 7.5.1, the $95\%$ confidence interval for $\sigma$ is
    
    $$[\frac{\sqrt{15}*27.2467}{\sqrt{27.488}},\frac{\sqrt{15}*27.2467}{\sqrt{6.262}}]$$
    $$=[20.1274,42.1699]$$
