For 317 games the margin of victory was recorded. The data gives $\bar{y}=4.57$ and $s=18.29$. Test the
existance of a home feild advantage with $H_0:\mu=0$ and $H_1:\mu>0$ at the 0.05 significance level.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, we have $n=317$, so we have 316 degrees of freedom. By the limitations of the t-table, we have
    $\infty$ degrees of freedom. So, $t_{0.05}=1.64$. Now,
    
    $$t_n=\frac{4.57-0}{\frac{18.29}{\sqrt{317}}}=4.4487$$
    
    Now, $4.4487>1.64$, so we reject $H_0$.

\end{solution}
