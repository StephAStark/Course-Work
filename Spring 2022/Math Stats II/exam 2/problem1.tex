A manager believes that experience is the most important factor for a salesperson. To examine this
belief, she records last month's sales (in \$1000s) and the years of experience of 10 randomly selected

\begin{enumerate}

    \item[1a] \input{part1a}
    \pagebreak
    \item[1b] \input{part1b}
    \pagebreak
    \item[1c] \input{part1c}
    \pagebreak
    \item[1d] \input{part1d}
    \pagebreak
    \item[1e] \input{part1e}
 
\end{enumerate}
