If $H_0:\mu=200$ is to be tested against $H_1:\mu<200$ at the $\alpha=0.1$ significance level with a
sample size of $n$ from a normal distribution where $\sigma=15$, what is the smallest sample size $n$
that will make the power equal to at least 0.75 when $\mu=197$?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, we have that $z=1.28=\frac{\bar{y}-200}{\frac{15}{\sqrt{n}}}$. Hence,
    $\bar{y}=200-1.28(\frac{15}{\sqrt{n}})$. Now,
    
    $$1-\beta=P(z\leq\frac{\bar{y}-197}{\frac{15}{\sqrt{n}}})=0.75$$
    
    That means $\frac{\bar{y}-197}{\frac{15}{\sqrt{n}}}=0.67$. So,
    $\bar{y}=197+0.67(\frac{15}{\sqrt{n}})$. Therefore
    
    $$200-1.28(\frac{15}{\sqrt{n}})=197+0.67(\frac{15}{\sqrt{n}})$$
    
    So, $3=0.67(\frac{15}{\sqrt{n}})+(1.28(\frac{15}{\sqrt{n}}))$ and hence
    $3\sqrt{n}=0.67(15)+1.28(15)$. Thus, we have that $n=(0.67(5)+1.28(5))^2=95.0625$. Therefore the
    smallest sample size for the desired result is $n=96$.
