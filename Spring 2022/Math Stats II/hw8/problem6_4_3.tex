For the decision rule found in 6.2.2 to test $H_0:\mu=95$ versus $H_1:\mu\neq95$ at the $\alpha=0.06$
significance level, calculate $1-\beta$ when $\mu=90$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We have that $H_0:\mu=95$ and $H_1:\mu\neq95$ given that $\sigma=15, \alpha=0.06$, and $n=22$.
    By 6.2.2, we also have that the decision rule is $89.2436\leq\bar{y}\leq100.7564$. So, given that
    $H_1:\mu=90$, we have that
    
    $$1-\beta=P(z\leq\frac{89.2436-90}{\frac{15}{\sqrt{22}}})$$
    $$+P(z\geq\frac{100.7564-90}{\frac{15}{\sqrt{22}}})$$
    $$=P(z\leq-0.2365)+P(z\geq3.3635)=0.4052+0.0012=0.4064$$

\end{solution}
