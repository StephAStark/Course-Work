Find a $95\%$ confidence interval for the difference in complication rates. Is there evidence that the
new sutures are better?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, we have that $n=77$ and $m=73$. So, the sample complication rates are
    $\hat{p}_x=\frac{9}{77}=0.1169$ and $\hat{p}_y=\frac{6}{73}=0.0822$. Then, our confidence interval
    is
    
    $$[(0.1169-0.0822)-1.96\sqrt{\frac{.1169(.8831)}{77}+\frac{.0822(.9178)}{73}},$$
    $$(0.1169-0.0822)+1.96\sqrt{\frac{.1169(.8831)}{77}+\frac{.0822(.9178)}{73}}]$$
    $$=[-0.0608, 0.1302]$$
    
    Since we have that the interval is of positive numbers, we can say that we are $95\%$ confident that
    the true difference in complication rates $p_x-p_y$ is in the interval. So, we can reasonably say
    that the new sutures are better in that they have a lower complication rate.
