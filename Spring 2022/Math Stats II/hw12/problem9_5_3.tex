Construct two $99\%$ confidence intervals for $\mu_X-\mu_Y$ using the data of Case Study 9.2.3, first
assuming the variances are equal, and then assuming they are not.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    First assume that the variances are equal for the datat of case study 9.2.3. The case study gicves
    us that $\bar{x}=18.6$ and $\bar{y}=21.9$. Also by the data, we have that
    
    $$s_p=\sqrt{\frac{115.9929(11)+35.7604(11)}{22}}=8.7107$$
    
    Hence our $99\%$ confidence interval is
    
    $$[(18.6-21.9)-2.8188(8.7107)(\sqrt{\frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{12}}),
    (18.6-21.9)+2.8188(8.7107)(\sqrt{\frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{12}})]$$
    $$=[-13.324, 6.724]$$
    
    Next, assume that the variances are unequal. Then, our degrees of freedom is
    
    $$\nu=\frac{(\frac{115.9929}{35.7604}+\frac{12}{12})^2}{\frac{10.521}{11}+\frac{1}{11}}=17.19$$
    
    That is, we have 17 degrees of freedom. So, our $99\%$ confidence interval is
    
    $$[-3.3-(2.8982)\sqrt{\frac{115.9929}{12}+\frac{35.7604}{12}},
    -3.3+(2.8982)\sqrt{\frac{115.9929}{12}+\frac{35.7604}{12}}]$$
    $$=[-13.6064, 7.0064]$$
