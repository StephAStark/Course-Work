Construct a $95\%$ confidence interval for $\frac{\sigma_X^2}{\sigma_Y^2}$ based on the data in Case
Study 9.2.1. The hypothesis test referred to tacitly assumed that the variances were equal. Does that
agree with your confidence interval? Explain.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, the sample variances given in the case study are $s_X^2=0.0002103$ and $s_Y^2=0.0000955$.
    Hence, the $95\%$ confidence interval is
    
    $$[\frac{0.0002103}{0.0000955}(0.238), \frac{0.0002103}{0.0000955}(4.82)]=[0.5241, 10.6141]$$
    
    Now, we are $95\%$ confident that the true proportion of the variances is in this interval. Since 1
    lies within this confidence interval, we can say, with $95\%$ confidence, that the variances are
    equal. So, we can reasonably say that the variances are equal.
