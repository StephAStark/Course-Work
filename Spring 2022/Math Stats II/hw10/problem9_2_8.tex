Is there evidence here that women $(n=6)$ metabolize methylmercury at a different rate than men
$(m=9)$ do? Do an appropriate two-sample $t$ test at the $\alpha=0.01$ level of significance. The two
sample standard deviations for these data are $s_X=15.1$ and $s_Y=8.1$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We have $n=6, \bar{x}=70.83, s_x=15.1, m=9, \bar{y}=79.33,$ and $s_y=8.1$. We will test
    $H_0:\mu_x=\mu_y$ against $H_1:\mu_x\neq\mu_y$. So, we have a pooled varaince
    
    $$s_p^2=\frac{(15.1)^2(5)+(8.1)^2(8)}{13}=128.07154$$
    
    Hence
    
    $$t=\frac{70.83-79.33}{\sqrt{128.07154(\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{9})}}=-1.4251$$
    
    Now with $6+9-2=13$ degrees of freedom, we have $t_{\alpha/2}=3.0123$. Then $-3.0123<t<3.0123$, so
    we fail to reject $H_0$.
