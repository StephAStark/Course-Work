Test that the heat-output variances for normal subjects $(n=10)$ and those with Raynaud's syndrome
$(m=10)$ are the same. Use a two-sided alternative and the 0.05 level of significance.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We will test $H_0:\sigma_x^2=\sigma_y^2$ against $H_1:\sigma_x^2\neq\sigma_y^2$. Well, the data
    gives us that $s_x^2=(0.37)^2=0.1369$ and $s_y^2=(0.2)^2=0.04$. So, $F=\frac{0.04}{0.1369}=0.2922$.
    Now, $F_{\alpha/2}=0.248$ and $F_{1-\alpha/2}=4.03$. So, $0.248<F<4.03$ and thus we fail to reject
    $H_0$.
