a. Let $X_1, X_2,\ldots, X_n$ denote the outcomes of a series of $n$ independent trials, where

$$f(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{lr}
      1 & $with proability $p \\
      0 & $with probability $1-p \\
\end{array} \right.$$

for $i=1,2,\ldots, n$. Let $X=X_1+\ldots+X_n$. Show $\hat{p}_1=X_1$ and $\hat{p}_2=\frac{X}{n}$ are
unbiased estimators for $p$.\\

b. Verify that $\hat{p}_2$ is a better estimator than $\hat{p}_1$ by comparing variances.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, here we have Bernoulli random variables, so $E(\hat{p}_1)=E(X_1)=p$. This also gives us
    
    $$E(\hat{p}_2)=E(\frac{X}{n})=\frac1n(E(X_1)+\ldots+E(X_n))=\frac1n(np)=p$$
    
    Thus, both estimators for $p$ are unbiased.\\
    Now, $Var(\hat{p}_1)=p(1-p)$. So,
    
    $$Var(\hat{p}_2)=Var(\frac{X}{n})=\frac{1}{n^2}(Var(X_1)+\ldots+Var(X_n))$$
    $$=\frac{1}{n^2}(n(p(1-p)))=\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$$
    
    Thus, we have that $Var(\hat{p}_2)<Var(\hat{p}_1)$ and so $\hat{p}_2$ is a better estimator.
