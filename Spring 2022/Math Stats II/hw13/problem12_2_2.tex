Do these data suggest that the direction of the Earth's magnetic field shifted over the time period
spanned by the eruptions? Let $\alpha=0.05$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We are testing $H_0:\mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3$ against $H_1:$not all$\mu_i$ are equal. Well, given the data,
    we have that $n=n_1+n_2+n_3=3+3+3=9$, $\bar{y}_1=59.4333, \bar{y}_2=55.9667, \bar{y}_3=51.7,$ and
    $\bar{y}=\frac19\sum_{i=1}^33(\bar{y}_i)=55.7$. Hence, we have $SSTR=90.02667$ and $SSE=17.6733$.
    So, our $F=15.28178$. Now, $F_{\alpha}=5.14$. Clearly $F>F_{\alpha}$, so we reject the magnetic
    field being the same over the years. That is, we can say with $95\%$ confidence that the Earth's
    magnetic field has shifted between the eruptions.
