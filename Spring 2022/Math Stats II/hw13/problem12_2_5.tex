Based on the results shown in the following table, is it conceivable that the four tribes were
contemporaries of one another? Let $\alpha=0.01$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We are testing $H_0:\mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3=\mu_4$. Now, $n=12$,
    $\bar{y}_1=983.3333, \bar{y}_2=950, \bar{y}_3=1466.6667, \bar{y}_4=1100$, and $\bar{y}=1125$. So,
    $SSTR=504166.6667$ and $SSE=363333.3333$. Therefore, we have that $F=3.7003$. Now,
    $F_{\alpha}=7.59$. Since $F<F_{\alpha}$, we fail to reject $H_0$. So, we can say with $99\%$
    confidence that the tribes were contemporaries.
