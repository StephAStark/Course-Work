Let $p_S$ and $p_{NS}$ denote the true probabilities of "Saucer on ground" in Spain and not in Spain,
respectively. Test $H_0:p_S=p_{NS}$ against a two-sided $H_1$. Let $\alpha=0.01$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We have $n=91$, and $m=1117$ and we are testing against $H_1:p_S\neq p_{NS}$. From the data, we have
    that
    
    $$p_e=\frac{53+705}{91+1117}=\frac{758}{1208}=0.6275$$
    
    So, we get
    
    $$z=\frac{\frac{53}{91}-\frac{705}{1117}}{\sqrt{\frac{0.6275*0.3725}{91}+\frac{0.6275*0.3725}{1117}}}
    =-0.9247$$
    
    Now, $z_{0.005}=2.58$. We see that $-2.58<z<2.58$, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
