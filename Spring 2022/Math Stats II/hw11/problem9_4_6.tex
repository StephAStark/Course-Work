Suppose $H_0:p_X=p_Y$ is being tested against $H_1:p_X \neq p_Y$ on the basis of two independent sets of
one hundred Bernoulli trials. If $x$, the number of successes in the first set, is sixty and $y$, the
number of successes in the second set, is forty-eight, what $P$-value would be associated with the
data?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well,
    
    $$p_e=\frac{60+48}{100+100}=\frac{108}{200}=0.54$$
    
    Hence
    
    $$z=\frac{0.6-0.48}{\sqrt{\frac{0.54(0.46)}{100}+\frac{0.54(0.46)}{100}}}=1.7025$$
    
    Now,
    
    $$P(z\leq-1.7025)+P(z\geq1.7025)=2P(z\leq-1.7025)=2(0.0446)=0.0892$$
    
    So, the $P$-value is $0.0892$.
