Suppose $H_0:p=0.45$ is to be tested against $H_1:p>0.45$ at the $\alpha=0.14$ level of significance,
where $p =P$(ith trial ends in success). If the sample size is two hundred, what is the smallest number
of successes that will cause $H_0$ to be rejected?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, our critical value is
    
    $$z=\frac{X-200(0.45)}{\sqrt{200(0.45(0.55))}}$$
    
    If we wish to reject $H_0$, then we need $z\geq z_{\alpha}=1.08$. That is

    $$\frac{X-200(0.45)}{\sqrt{200(0.45(0.55))}}\geq1.08$$
    
    Hence
    
    $$x\geq1.08(\sqrt{200(0.45)(0.55)})+200(0.45)=97.5985$$
    
    So, we would need at least $98$ succeses to reject $H_0$.
