If $H_0:\mu=\mu_0$ is rejected in favor of $H_1:\mu>\mu_0$, will it necessarily be rejected in favor of
$H_1:\mu\neq\mu_0$? Assume that $\alpha$ remains the same.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    No. If we were to assume that $\alpha=0.05$, then $z_{\alpha}=1.64$ and $z_{\alpha/2}=1.96$. So, if
    $z=1.72$, then $H_0$ would be rejected for $H_1:\mu>\mu_0$, but not for $H_1:\mu\neq\mu_0$.

\end{solution}
