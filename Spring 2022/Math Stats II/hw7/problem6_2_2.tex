A random sample of twenty-two children diagnosed with the condition have been drinking Berry Smart daily
for two months. Past experience suggests that children with ADD score an average of 95 on the IQ test
with a standard deviation of 15. If the data are to be analyzed using the $\alpha=0.06$ level of
significance, what values of $\bar{y}$ would cause $H_0$ to be rejected? Assume that $H_1$ is
two-sided.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, if we wanted to fail to reject $H_0$, then we would want
    
    $$-z_{\alpha/2}<\frac{\bar{y}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}<z_{\alpha/2}$$
    
    That is we would want
    
    $$-1.88<\frac{\bar{y}-95}{\frac{15}{\sqrt{22}}}<1.88$$
    
    Therefore we would have $89.2436<\bar{y}<100.7564$. Thus, to reject $H_0$, we would need
    $\bar{y}\leq89.2436$ or $\bar{y}\geq100.7564$.

\end{solution}
