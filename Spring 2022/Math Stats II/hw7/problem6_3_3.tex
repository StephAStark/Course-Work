A newly released poll claims to have contacted a random sample of one hundred twenty of the politician's
current supporters and found that seventy-two were men. In the election that he lost, exit polls
indicated that $65\%$ of those who voted for him were men. Using an $\alpha=0.05$ level of significance,
test the null hypothesis that the proportion of hismale supporters has remained the same. Make the
alternative hypothesis one-sided.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Well, we have a sample proportion of $\hat{p}=\frac{72}{120}=0.6$. So, we will set the alternative
    hypothesis to $H_1:p<0.65$. Now, or critical value is
    $z=\frac{72-120(0.65)}{\sqrt{120(0.65)(0.35)}}=-1.1483$. However, $z>z_{\alpha}=-1.64$, so we fail
    to reject $H_0:p=0.65$.

\end{solution}
