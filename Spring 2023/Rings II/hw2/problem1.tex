Prove that a module $_RQ$ is injective if and only if for every left ideal $I$ of $R$ and every
$R$-homomorphism $f:I\to Q$ there is a homomorphsim $g:R\to Q$ with $g|_I=f$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $_RQ$ be a module. Assume first that $_RQ$ is injective. Let $I\subset R$ be an ideal and let
    $f:I\to Q$ be an $R$-homomorphsim. Since $_RQ$ is injective, we have that for any two left
    $R$-modules $X,Y$ such that $\phi:X\to Y$ is an injective $R$-homomorphism, and $\psi:X\to Q$ is
    any $R$-homomorphism, then there exists and $R$-homomorphism $\rho:Y\to Q$ such that
    $\psi=\phi\rho$.\\

    On the other hand, assume that for every left ideal $I\subseteq R$ and every $R$-homomorphism
    $f:I\to Q$ there is a homomorphism $g:R\to Q$ such that $g|_I=f$.
