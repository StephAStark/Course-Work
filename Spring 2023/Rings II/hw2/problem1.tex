Prove that a module $_RQ$ is injective if and only if for every left ideal $I$ of $R$ and every
$R$-homomorphism $f:I\to Q$ there is a homomorphsim $g:R\to Q$ with $g|_I=f$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Let $_RQ$ be a module. Assume first that $_RQ$ is injective.\\
    On the other hand, assume that for every left ideal $I\subseteq R$ and every $R$-homomorphism
    $f:I\to Q$ there is a homomorphism $g:R\to Q$ such that $g|_I=f$.
