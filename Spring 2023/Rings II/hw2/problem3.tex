\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\

     Assume that the former above sequence is split exact and that $F:RMod\to SMod$ is as stated. Since
     $F$ is an additive functor, we have that for all $\phi,\psi\in Mor(X,Y)$ and
     $X,Y\in Ob(\mathcal{C})$, then $F(\phi+\psi)=F(\phi)+F(\psi)$. Also, since $F$ is covariant, we
     have that for all $\phi\in Mor(X,Y)$ with $\phi:X\to Y$, then $F(\phi):F(X)\to F(Y)$. Since the
     former short exact sequence splits, we have that there exists $f':M\to K$ and $g':N\to M$. Hence,
     there exists $F(f'):F(M)\to F(K)$ and $F(g'): F(N)\to F(M)$. Therefore, the latter sequence splits.
     By the work that wee have done, we have that the latter sequence is exact at $F(K)$ and $F(N)$ due
     to the kernal and the image being $0$ respectively. So, all we need is for the latter to be exact
     at $F(M)$. Let $\phi\in Im(F(f))$. Then there exists a homomorphism $\psi$ such that
     $\phi=\psi\circ f$. So,
     
     $$(\phi)F(g)=\phi g=(\psi f)g=\psi(fg)=\psi(0)=0$$

     Hence, $\phi\in\ker(F(g))$. On the other hand, let $\phi\in\ker(F(g))$. That is, $\phi g=0$ which
     yields $Im(\phi)\subseteq\ker(g)=Im(f)$. Therefore, there exists $k\in K$ such that $\phi=(a)f$.
     Now define $\psi$ by $\psi=a$. Then $\phi=(a)f=(\psi)f$. Thus, $\phi\in Im(F(f))$. As such, the
     latter sequence is a split exact sequence as desired.
