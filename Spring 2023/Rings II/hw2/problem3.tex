Suppose

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
     0 \arrow{r} & K \arrow{r}{f} & M \arrow{r}{g} & N \arrow{r} & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

is a split exact sequence of left $R$-modules. Suppose also that $F:RMod\to SMod$ is an additive
covariant functor. Show that

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
     0 \arrow{r} & F(K) \arrow{r}{F(f)} & F(M) \arrow{r}{F(g)} & F(N) \arrow{r} & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

is a split exact sequence of left $S$-modules.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
     Assume that the former above sequence is split exact and that $F:RMod\to SMod$ is as stated. Since
     $F$ is an additive functor, we have that for all $\phi,\psi\in Mor(X,Y)$ and
     $X,Y\in Ob(\mathcal{C})$, then $F(\phi+\psi)=F(\phi)+F(\psi)$. Also, since $F$ is covariant, we
     have that for all $\phi\in Mor(X,Y)$ with $\phi:X\to Y$, then $F(\phi):F(X)\to F(Y)$.
