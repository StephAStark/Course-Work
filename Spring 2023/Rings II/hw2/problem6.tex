Let $M$ be a left $R$-module. Let $F$ be the standard contravariant Hom functor associated to $M'$. So
$F:RMod\to \mathbb{Z}Mod$ is given by $F(N)=\text{Hom}_R(N,M)$ for each left $R$-module $N$ and for each
$f:P\to Q$ in $RMod, F(f)=f^*:\text{Hom}_R(Q,M)\to\text{Hom}_R(P,M)$ where $f^*(\phi)=f\phi$ for each
$\phi\in\text{Hom}_R(Q,M)$. Prove that $F$ is left exact.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\

    Let $M$ be a left $R$-module and $F$ be as given. Let

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        0 \arrow{r} & K \arrow{r}{f} & M \arrow{r}{g} & N \arrow{r} & 0
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}

    be an exact sequence of $R$-modules. We want to show that

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        0 \arrow{r} & F(K) \arrow{r}{F(f)} & F(M) \arrow{r}{F(g)} & F(N)
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}

    is exact. By similar reasoning as in problem 3, we have that $F$ is exact at $F(K)$. So, we need
    exactness at $F(M)$ and $F(N)$. By $F$ being the $\text{Hom}$ functor and being contravariant, we
    have that $F$ is also exact at $F(N)$.
