Prove that any projective right $R$-module is flat.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\

    Let $P$ be a projective right $R$-module. Since $P$ is projective, we have that $M=P\oplus Q$ where
    $Q$ is another right $R$-module and $M$ is a free right $R$-module. Now, let $A,B$ be right
    $R$-modules with $f:A\to B$ a monomorphism. to show that $P$ is flat, we will show that
    $1\otimes f:M\otimes A\to M\otimes B$ is also injective. To this end, let
    $\sum m_i\otimes a_i\in M\otimes A$ and assume that $1\otimes f(\sum m_i\otimes a_i)=0$. As such,
    $\sum m_i\otimes a_i$ can be writen as a finite sum. Whence, all of the $m_i$ are elements of some
    finitely generated free submodule $M'$ of $M$. So, $1\otimes f(\sum m_i\otimes a_i)=0$ in 
    $M'\otimes B$. Thus, $\sum m_i\otimes a_i=0$ in $M'\otimes A$ and therefore in $M\otimes A$. With
    this, and the work that we did in problem 1, we have that

    $$1\otimes f:(P\otimes A)\oplus(Q\otimes A)\to (P\otimes B)\oplus(Q\otimes B)$$

    is also injective. Therefore,
    
    $$1\otimes f:(P\otimes A)\to (P\otimes B)$$

    is injective as well. Thus, $P$ is flat as desired.
