Find the matrix $I-A_F^t$, and compute its Smith normal form. Show that your answer to (c) is consistent
with your answer to (a).\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Using the relations defined in part a, we have that $A_E$ is given by

    $$\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array}\right)$$

    So

    $$I-A_F^t=\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 0 & -1 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \end{array}\right)$$

    Now, using the builtin smithForm function in Matlab gives an error as the above matrix is singular,
    so we instead use the numbertheory online Smith Form calculator to get the following Smith Normal
    Form:

    $$\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right)$$

    So, by the Theorem that states that $V(L_K(F))\setminus\{0\}\cong\bigoplus_{m_i}\mathbb{Z}_{m_i}$
    for $m_i$ the $ith$ diagonal component of the Smith Normal Form matrix, we get that:

    $$V(L_K(F))\setminus\{0\}\cong\mathbb{Z}$$

    which does agree with our work from 9a.
