Let $E_N = \inf_p||p(x)-e^x||_{\infty}$, where $||f||_{\infty}=\sup_{x\in[-1,1]}|f (x)|$, denote the error in
degree $N$ minimax polynomial approximation to $e^x$ on $[-1, 1]$. (a) One candidate approximation $p(x)$ would be
the Taylor series truncated at degree $N$. From this approximation, derive the bound $E_N<((N + 2)/(N + 1))/(N + 1)!$
for $N\geq0$. (b) In fact, the truncated Taylor series falls short of optimal by a factor of about $2^N$, 
for it is known (see equation (6.75) of [Mei67]) that as $N\rightarrow\infty$, $E_N\sim2^{-N}/(N + 1)!$. Modify
Program 9 to produce a plot showing this asymptotic formula, the upper bound of (a), the error when $p(x)$ is obtained 
from interpolation in Chebyshev points, and the same for equispaced points, all as a function of $N$ for
$N = 1, 2, 3,\ldots,12$. Comment on the results.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We know that the Taylor series expansion of $e^x$ about $x=0$ is given by $\sum\frac{x^n}{n!}$. So, the truncated
    series is $1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\ldots+\frac{x^N}{N!}$. Hence, $|p(x)-e^x|=|R_N(x)|$ where $R_N(x)$ is the remainder
    of the exact Taylor expansion of $e^x$. We also know that such an expansion exists as $e^x$ is an analytic function.
    So,

    $$E_N=\sup_{x\in[-1,1]}|\sum_{k=N+1}^{\infty}\frac{x^k}{k!}|$$

    $$=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(N+k)!}$$

    $$=\frac{1}{(N+1)!}(1+\frac{1}{N+2}+\frac{1}{(N+2)(N+3)}+\dots)$$

    $$<\frac{1}{(N+1)!}(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(N+2)^k})$$

    Here, we have a geometric series, so we get the equality

    $$=\frac{1}{(N+1)!}\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{N+2}}$$

    $$=\frac{1}{(N+1)!}\frac{1}{\frac{N+2}{N+2}-\frac{1}{N-2}}$$

    $$=\frac{N+2}{N+1}\frac{1}{(N+1)!}$$

    as desired.\\

    Now, plotting the error bound we found, the known error bound, and the error of the approximations of $e^x$ yields us
