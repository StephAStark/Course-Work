The only traveling "front" wasve $u(x,t) = \Phi(x - ct)$ with $\Phi(-\infty)=1$ and $\Phi(\infty)=0$
is given by:

$$u(x,t) = [1+exp(\frac{x}{\sqrt{6}} - \frac56t)]^{-2}$$

Verify this assertion by deriving the ODE that $\Phi$ has to satisfy and then use a numerical method to
solve it.[Also try analytically!]\\
