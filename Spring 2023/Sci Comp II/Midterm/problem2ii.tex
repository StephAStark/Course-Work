Since $u(x,t)\to0$ (resp. 1) as $x\to\infty$ (resp. $-\infty$), we can approximate the traveling
wave given in (i) in $(-L,L)$ wehre $L$ is large enough so that the wave front does not reach the
boundary $x=L$, by imposing the boundary conditions

$$u(-L,t) = 1,\;\;u(L,t) = 0$$

and taking the initial value as $u(x,0)$. Design and implement a Chebyshev collocation method to
approximate the solution of the PDE and study the convergence if the approximate solution as $N$ is
increasing.\\
