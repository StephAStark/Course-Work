Modify Program 3 to determine the maximum error over $\mathbb{R}$ in the sinc function interpolants
of the square wave and the hat function, and to produce a log-log plot of these two error maxima as
functions of $h$. (Good choices for $h$ are $2^{-3}$, $2^{-4}$, $2^{-5}$ , $2^{-6}$.) What convergence
rates do you observe as $h\rightarrow0$?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Here, we have the graphs of the functions with increasing $h$ values, and we can clearly see that
    the error for the computations decreases as $h\rightarrow0$. It also seems to settle after
    $h=2^{-5}$.

I was not sure how to get the loglog plot to work.
