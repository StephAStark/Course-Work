By manipulating Taylor series, determine the constant $C$ for an error expansion of (1.3) of the
form $w_j-u'(x_j)\sim Ch^4u^{(5)}(x_j)$, where $u^{(5)}$ denotes the fifth derivative. Based on this
value of $C$ and on the formula for $u^{(5)}(x)$ with $u(x)=e^{\sin(x)}$ determine the leading term in
the expansion for $w_j-u'(x_j)$ for $u(x)=e^{\sin(x)}$ (You will have to find
$\max_{x\in[-\pi,\pi]}|u^{(5)}(x)|$ numerically.) Modify Program 1 so that it plots the dashed line
corresponding to this leading term rather than just $N^{-4}$. This adjusted dashed line should fit the
data almost perfectly. Plot the difference between the two on a log-log scale and verify that it shrinks
at the rate $\mathcal{O}(h^6)$.\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    We are given the differential matrix

    $$D=\frac{1}{h}\left(\begin{array}{ccccc} \ddots & \ddots & \dots & \frac{1}{12} & -\frac23
                                           \\ \ddots & \ddots & -\frac{1}{12} & \ddots & \frac{1}{12}
                                           \\ \ddots & \ddots & \frac23 & \ddots & \ddots
                                           \\ \ddots & \ddots & 0 & \ddots & \ddots
                                           \\ \ddots & \ddots & -\frac23 & \ddots & \ddots
                                           \\ -\frac{1}{12} & \ddots & \frac{1}{12} & \ddots & \ddots
                                           \\ \frac23 & -\frac{1}{12} & \dots & \ddots & \ddots
                    \end{array}\right)$$

    So we can, from 1.3, write the equation

    $$w_j=\frac{1}{h}(-\frac{1}{12}u_{j-2}+\frac23u_{j-1}-\frac23u_{j+1}+\frac{1}{12}u_{j+2})$$
    
    Therefore, by expanding each non $u_j$ term about $u_j$, we get

    $$w_j=\frac{1}{h}(\frac{1}{12}(-u+2hu'-2h^2u''+\frac{8}{6}h^3u'''-\frac23h^4u''''+
    \frac{1}{45}h^5u''''')$$
    $$+\frac23(u-hu'+\frac12h^2u''-\frac16h^3u'''+\frac{1}{24}h^4u''''-\frac{1}{120}h^5u''''')$$
    $$+\frac23(-u-hu'-\frac12h^2u''-\frac16h^3u'''-\frac{1}{24}h^4u''''-\frac{1}{120}h^5u''''')$$
    $$+\frac{1}{12}(u+2hu'+2h^2u''+\frac86h^3u'''+\frac23h^4u''''+\frac{1}{45}h^5u'''''))$$
    $$=\frac1h(-hu'+\frac{1}{30}h^5u''''')=-u'+\frac{1}{30}h^4u'''''$$

    where $u$ and its derivatives denote $u(x_j)$. Hence, we get a $C$ value of $C=\frac{1}{30}$. Now,
    taking the max value of $u^{(5)}$ on $[-\pi,\pi]$, we get $\max|u^{(5)}|=24.811$. Therefore, using
    the above equation and $C$ value that we found, we get the following graph where the approximation
    is almost perfectly in line with the dotted line.
