Run Programs 1 and 2 with $e^{\sin(x)}$ replaced by (a) $e^{\sin^2(x)}$ and (b) $e^{\sin(x)|\sin(x)|}$
and with uprime adjusted appropriately. What rates of convergence do you observe?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    a. The rates of convergence seem to be roughly the same as that of the original $e^{\sin(x)}$
    function. They might be a little slower, though the convergence is still very much present and
    similar to that of the original.\\

b. The rates of convergence for $e^{\sin(x)|\sin(x)|}$ are drastically different than that of part a and
the original. That is to say, the error tends upward instaed of downward as the iterations increase.
This is due to discontinuities in the derivative of the function.
