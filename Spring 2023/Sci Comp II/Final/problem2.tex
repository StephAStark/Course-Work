a. Modify the RBF interpolantion to include a polynomial correction. In 2D, this amounts to searching
the interpolant in the form

$$F(\bf{x}) = \sum_{j=1}^Nc_j\phi(||\bf{x}-\bf{x}_j||) + p(\bf{x})$$

where $p(x) = p(x, y) = gamma_1 + \gamma_2x + \gamma_3y$. [See Fornberg (2016) Part 1 for details ]\\

b. Solve the analogous problem in 3D, stating that given a 3D point cloud, find an implicit surface
that approximates these N points using RBF interpolants.\\

c. Revisit Exercise 1 by using the Machine Learning approach of the RBF Networks, to obtain a RBF best
fit approximation\\\\
