a. Apply the RBF-PS method to solve the heat equation and Helmholtz equation (eigenvalue problem for the
Laplacian) in 1D. (The relevant material is Chapter 42-43 in Fasshauer).\\

b. Describe the RBF-PS method in 2D (the implementation is optional).\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\

    a. For the implementation here, we take the work that we did previously and instead of solving for
    the coeeficients using our RBF matrix, we use this matrix as a differentiation matrix.\\

    b. To do this in the 2 dimensional case, we would need to look back at our work in spectral methods
    in 2D.
