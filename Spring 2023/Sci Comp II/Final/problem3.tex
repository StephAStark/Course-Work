a. Apply the RBF-PS method to solve the heat equation and Helmholtz equation (eigenvalue problem for the
Laplacian) in 1D. (The relevant material is Chapter 42-43 in Fasshauer).\\

b. Describe the RBF-PS method in 2D (the implementation is optional).\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\

    a. For the implementation here, we take the work that we did previously and instead of solving for
    the coeeficients using our RBF matrix, we use this matrix as a differentiation matrix. So, we will
    solve the system:
    
    $$(A'' A^{-1})u=u_t$$
    
    where $A''$ is the matrix $A$ using the second derivative of the RBF instead of the RBF itself.
    Solving the heat equation $u_t=u_{xx}$, we have the following code.\\

    b. To do this in the 2 dimensional case, we would need to look back at our work in spectral methods
    in 2D.
