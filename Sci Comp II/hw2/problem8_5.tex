Find a way to modify your program of Exercise 8.4, as in Exercise 3.8 but now for a second-order
problem, to make use of matrix exponentials rather than time discretization. What effect does this have
on the computation time?\\\\

\begin{solution}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\
    Using the code that we worked through in class, we have the following code. From the code, we have
    that the elapsed time is about $0.0065$ seconds. For the original code, adding in the tic/toc
    function, we get that the average elapsed time is about $0.5$ seconds.

\end{solution}
