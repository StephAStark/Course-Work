Consider Fisher's equation:

$$u_t = u_{xx} + u(1 - u)$$

(i) The only traveling "front" wasve $u(x,t) = \Phi(x - ct)$ with $\Phi(-\infty)=1$ and $\Phi(\infty)=0$
is given by:

$$u(x,t) = [1+exp(\frac{x}{\sqrt{6}} - \frac56t)]^{-2}$$

Verify this assertion by deriving the ODE that $\Phi$ has to satisfy and then use a numerical method to
solve it.[Also try analytically!]\\

(ii) Since $u(x,t)\to0$ (resp. 1) as $x\to\infty$ (resp. $-\infty$), we can approximate the traveling
wave given in (i) in $(-L,L)$ wehre $L$ is large enough so that the wave front does not reach the
boundary $x=L$, by imposing the boundary conditions

$$u(-L,t) = 1,\;\;u(L,t) = 0$$

and taking the initial value as $u(x,0)$. Design and implement a Chebyshev collocation method to
approximate the solution of the PDE and study the convergence if the approximate solution as $N$ is
increasing.
